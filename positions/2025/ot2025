size: *6'5 320, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 career snaps 0 pressures, 0 RBLK 0 PBLK
info: 21 years old. 4 star Recruit out of Nevilee in Monroe LA, top 10 Tackle. True freshman starter where he was a Freshman All American. Started every game as a sophomore allowing 0 sacks and being a 1st team All SEC Selection by the coaches.
pros: Good feet in pass pro. Smooth pass protector with good change of direction. Uses hands well, keeps fighting to get his hands fit. Good power then the run game can move players. Good size. Started and played well as a true freshman. Strong hands.
cons: Plays a little high, needs to play with better leverage. Length can give him issues. Not an elite athlete, can get beat by the freaky edge rushers. Dont’t love his narrow stance.
take: Campbell was a NFL ready tackle prospect at a very young age. He has the natural power to help in the run game to go along with the high level pass pro that is needed in a tackle. He plays very in control and with good technique, that will serve him well as an instant starter in the NFL.

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,778 career snaps 10 pressures, 81 RBLK 89.9 PBLK
info: Banks was a 5 star recruit out of Summer Creek TX where he was an All American. He committed to Texas and became the starting LT immediately even earning Freshman All American and a 2nd team All Big 12 selection. He improved as a Sophomore where he became a 2nd team All American and a 1st team All Big 12 selection.

cons: Needs a stronger anchor. Not very aggressive in the run game. Off balance too often in the run game.
take: Banks has the potential to be an elite pass protector in the NFL. He’s got the size and moves very well for it as well as uses his hands well.  He's only missing the top level aggression and physicality that would make him a top tier prospect.
OT Josh Simmons Ohio St 80
size: *6'5 310, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 career snaps 0 pressures, 0 RBLK 0 PBLK
info: 22 years old. Simmons was a 3 star recruit out of Helix in La Mesa CA where he committed to San Diego St. He played there 2 seasons before transferring as a 4 star OT to OSU. He started every game at LT at OSU in 2023.
pros: Solid size. Can move guys in the run game. Looks like a very physically capable guard.
cons: Not the most athletic tackle, doesn't move as well as you would like. Lets guys into his chest. Pass sets are not great, turns shoulders early.
take: Simmons is a big solid athlete that excels in the run game. He can really move people but he’s a liability in pass pro on the edge. If he is kicked into guard he could be a solid NFL player.

cons: Slow to get to run block responsibilities. Not a people mover. Needs a better anchor.
take: Conerly is a solid sized LT that has the potential to develop into a starter. He has a long way to go before then. He must add Strength to his frame and become more aggressive to be an impact OL.

OT Wyatt Milum West Virginia 77
size: *6'6 312, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,933 career snaps 8 pressures, 87.5 RBLK 90.0 PBLK
info: Milum was the top rated recruit from West Virginia and stayed close to home committing to West Virginia. He started 8 games as a true freshman at RT and was named a Freshman All American. He then switched to LT for 2022 and beyond where he was the full time starter the rest of his career grading out well and being named 1st team All Academic.
pros: 5 star top recruit. Very experienced Tackle. Started as a true freshman and played solid. Played both LT and RT in career. Solid athlete at size. Solid anchor. Wins his reps more often than not. Solid aggression in the run game, high effort.
cons: Off balance too often. Drops his head on contact too much. Bad hands in pass pro, doesn’t throw punches well. Slow to get hat across defenders. Usually wins ugly.
take: Milum is a solid lineman that has the physical tools and aggression to be a starting NFL OL. He needs work though, his hands and feet aren’t going to allow him to start right away. He should be drafted and developed and could turn into a solid starter.
OT Emery Jones LSU 77
size: *6'6 320, NA arms, NA hands.

info: *21 years old. 4 star recruit out of Baton Rouge LA. Started as a true freshman and was Freshman All SEC 1st team with his teammate Campbell. Played all but one game in 2023, was 2nd team All SEC by the coaches, and LSU OL of the year.
pros: Started as a true freshman. Got better from his first year. Good size. Loves to finish his blocks. Good athlete, can move well.
cons: Lunges too much in pass pro. Plays a little too high. Gets beat too much 1v1 in space. Can get walked back because he lets defenders in his pads.
take: Jones is a physically talented OL that is still improving. He has very good feet and a good build, but his technique is off especially in pass pro. He is over aggressive in space causing him to whiff or get off balance too often.
OT Marcus Mbow Purdue 76
size: *6'5 300, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 1,863 career snaps 21 pressures, 75.9 RBLK 73 PBLK
info: 22 years old. 3 star recruit out of Wauwatosa East in Milwaukee WI.
pros: 3 year starter at guard and tackle with grades in the 70s. Good athlete, moves well in space. Solid power to the run game, works hard. Solid length. Fast feet. Finishes blocks well.
cons: Very grabby, hands outside of the defenders frame a lot. On the thinner side, anchor may be a problem. Hate his stance, too narrow. Leans and is off balance too often.
take: Mbow has the physical tools to be a starting NFL OT. He flashes really good moments of aggression and athleticism, but its inconsistent. He needs to refine his technique and fundamentals but if he does he’s a good OT.
OT Ajani Cornelius Oregon 76
size: *6'5 310, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 career snaps 0 pressures, 0 RBLK 0 PBLK
info: 23 years old. No star recruit out of White Plains where he won back to back state championships. Went to Rhode Island for 3 years where he developed into a dominant OT. He was a 4 star transfer that got offers to a lot of power 5 programs. Went to Oregon to start every game at RT allowing 0 sacks.
pros: Works hard in the run game. Got the job done in pass pro, didn’t get beat too often. Moves well, good athlete.
cons: On the skinnier side, should add more mass. Pass pro hands are mediocre, doesn’t get hands on well. Sloppy looking pass pro.
take: Cornelius is a long athletic tackle that has played well in his college career. He’s on the skinnier side so he will have to build up his strength more and develop his hand technique to be a starting NFL OT.

info: 5 star recruit out of Stoughton Wisconsin.
pros: 4 year starter, over 3000 career snaps. High pedigree recruit. Wisconsin OL. Solid pass sets, good positioning. Good hands, refits and strikes well.
cons: Not an overly physical OL. Doesn’t move DL in the run game. Feet aren’t that quick. Slow to recover from being beat.
take: Nelson didn’t truly live up to the 5 star hype he had out of HS, he’s not athletically gifted enough to be a highly sought after OT. He’s played 4 very good seasons for the badgers and can play in the NFL.

stat: 0 career snaps 0 pressures, 0 RBLK 0 PBLK
info: *23 years old. 3 star recruit out of Beech Grove IN. Redshirted 2020 and was a backup for 2 more years until becoming a starter in 2023.
pros: Shows flashes of good hands in pass pro. Solid zone blocker.
cons: Not a very good athlete. Shorter arms. Stiff. No push in the run game.
take: Fryar is a solid college offensive lineman that has nice hand technique in pass pro. He’s not the longest or most athletic lineman though which limits his potential. He may be able to become a backup NFL OL.
