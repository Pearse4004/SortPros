LB Justin Barron Syracuse 71

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 tackles 0 sacks 0 INT 0 PBU, 0 RDEF 0 TACK 0 PRSH 0 COV
info: 23 years old. Barron was a star player on both sides of the ball for Suffield Academy in CT. He was a 3 star recruit and a top 100 athlete committing to play in Syracuse on the defensive side. He was a special teams player in 2020 before starting as the hybrid safety/linebacker for the rest of his career. He broke out in 2023 serving as a team captain and was a Honorable mention All-ACC member.
pros: Very versatile player, played S, LB, and slot. Good athlete for a LB. Good size and length. Plays physically at safety. Good in coverage, see’s and breaks on routes well.
cons: Lowers his head to make tackles, causing misses or penalties. Never played in the box and stopped the run. As a safety doesn't move as fluid as you want to see.
take: Barron is a physically imposing defender, he has the size, length and athleticism of an NFL LB. He’s played DB in college so he has a solid feel for coverage and making plays in space. Playing LB will be a big difference in the NFL but physically he can do it.

stat: 34 tackles 3 sacks 0 INT 0 PBU, 64.2 RDEF 67.4 TACK 88.3 PRSH 51 COV
info: 24 years old. 4 star recruit out of Westfield in Chantilly VA. Played 3 seasons at North Carolina.
pros: Starting experience in the SEC. Dangerous blitzer, very physical and aggressive. Plus athlete. Team captain.
cons: Older player that took a while to get on the field. Tad undersized. Not much of an in the box run thumper, gets blocked easy. Nearly no ball production in the pass gave throughout his career. Just a little slow reacting.
take: Asante is a physical player that will hold up to NFL athleticism. He’s an older prospect that doesn’t react as quick as you would hope a very experienced LB would. He can be a good special teams player and fill in on defense.
LB Marlowe Wax Syracuse 70
size: *6'0 230, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 tackles 0 sacks 0 INT 0 PBU, 0 RDEF 0 TACK 0 PRSH 0 COV
info: 22 years old. Wax was a star 2 way player at RB and LB in HS. He was a 3 star RB recruit out of Baltimore MD where he committed to Cuse over schools like Pitt and Temple. In 2020 he played in every game and even had a start as a true freshman. He proceeded to start the rest of his career and had a great 2023 season where he was a team captain and named 2nd team All-ACC.
pros: Good tackler, has a solid career Missed tackle rate. Solid QB spy, plays pursuit well. Solid at dipping under blockers. Solid at finding windows to attack in the run game. Solid instincts.
cons: Shorter linebacker without the length. Sub par NFL athlete. Lacking long speed. Doesn’t stack and shed very well. Gets eaten up when blockers get hands on him.
take: Wax was the leader of the Syracuse defense where he was a sure tackler and a good QB spy. He shows the ability to find windows and slip under blocks to make plays regularly. He’s not the rangiest LB, he’s on the shorter side and isn’t a fast LB which will limit his chances to play in the NFL.
