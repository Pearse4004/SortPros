LB Eugene Asante Auburn 70
size: *6'1 219, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 34 tackles 3 sacks 0 INT 0 PBU, 64.2 RDEF 67.4 TACK 88.3 PRSH 51 COV
info: 24 years old. 4 star recruit out of Westfield in Chantilly VA. Played 3 seasons at North Carolina.
pros: Starting experience in the SEC. Dangerous blitzer, very physical and aggressive. Plus athlete. Team captain.
cons: Older player that took a while to get on the field. Tad undersized. Not much of an in the box run thumper, gets blocked easy. Nearly no ball production in the pass gave throughout his career. Just a little slow reacting.
take: Asante is a physical player that will hold up to NFL athleticism. He’s an older prospect that doesn’t react as quick as you would hope a very experienced LB would. He can be a good special teams player and fill in on defense.
