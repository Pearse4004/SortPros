info: 23 years old. 4 star recruit out of Indian River in Portsmouth VA. He played 2 seasons at Florida before transferring to Virginia Tech.
pros: 3 straight years of plus pass rushing. Great get off, very quick. Productive pass rusher. Explosive edge rusher with good burst. Good hands while pass rushing. Good stunting edge pass rusher. Plays good technique in the run game.
cons: Not a long edge rusher. Couldn’t get on the field much at Florida early in his career. Wont be a stout run defender because of his size.
take: Powell-Ryland is an excellent college edge rusher that can play in the NFL. He has the technique to rush the passer and play the run at the next level. He just doesn’t have the prototypical size of an edge rusher that goes early.
