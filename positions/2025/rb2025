RB Ashton Jeanty Boise St 88
size: *5'8 215, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 375 attempts 2,595 yards 29 TDs 4 Fum, 96.6 RUN 54.4 RECV 151 MFT
info: 21 years old. 4-star recruit out of Lone Star in Frisco, TX where he was a dominant WR before switching to RB. Committed to Boise State, where he rushed for 821 yards and 7 TDs as a freshman. Followed that up with 1,347 rushing yards and 14 TDs in his sophomore year, adding 569 receiving yards and 5 receiving TDs. In 2024, he rushed for 2,497 yards and 29 TDs, finishing second in the Heisman voting and winning the Doak Walker Award as the nation's top RB.
pros: Good receiver, featured part of the game and a former WR. Good vision. Good athlete, solid change of direction and acceleration. Great contact balance. Good combination of power and speed in space. Ultra productive.
cons: Fumbles too many times. Played against lower level competition. Very short, no length to his game.
take: Jeanty is one of the better running backs coming out of college over the last few years. He has a blend of power and speed along with great vision which allows him to rack up massive numbers. He’s not the biggest or fastest RB so he won't be a top 5 pick but he’s as good as a prospect gets.
RB Treveyon Henderson Ohio St 82
size: *5'10 208, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 145 attempts 1,010 yards 10 TDs 0 Fum, 91.8 RUN 74.5 RECV 37 MFT
info: 22 years old. Henderson was the top RB recruit in the country coming out of Hopewell VA where he was dominate. He ran for over 4000 yards in his career and earned himself VA Gatorade PoY in 2019-2020. He commited to OSU where he immediately made an impact and rushed for 1,248 yards as a true freshman. The next two years he didn’t eclipse the 1k yard mark causing him to come back and team up with Judkins to make the best backfield in the country.
pros: Came in as a true freshman and dominated. Not many fumbles in his career, protects the ball. Solid production in the pass game, can block and receive. Low center of gravity, plays with good pad level. Good burst. Plays well in a phone booth, makes people miss in tight space. Great championship run.
cons: Has delt with injuries that reduced his production after his freshman year. Not an elite athlete, won't break any pursuit angles. Not an overpowering or overwhelming RB, not physically special.
take: Henderson is a very good running back that is good in all aspects of the position. He is great in a phone booth where he can maneuver around defenders and show off his strength and agility. Injuries have been an issue in the past and may have hurt his speed a bit, but he can be a starting NFL RB.
RB Quinshon Judkins Ohio St 81

pros: Immediately started and made a massive impact in the SEC. Very productive RB. Doesn’t fumble very often. Forces a lot of missed tackles. Physical and solid enough technique to be a good blocker. Keeps legs churning to always fight for yards. Elite burst, can hit very small windows quickly. Muscular build, takes a lot to get him down. Good contact balance. Good vision and instincts.
cons: Not used as a weapon in the receiving game. Not a plus blocker as of now. Doesn’t do the best job of yards after contact, rarely breaks a tackle to create big plays.
take: Judkins is a hard running RB that has elite burst to go along with his physical running style. He has always produced at a high level and is expected to be a RB 1 immediately in the NFL.

cons: Not a juiced up elusive back, wont see him juke anyone out. Change of direction isn’t a strength.
take: Hampton is a no nonsense, physical, north and south runner. He has elite burst and power to get every yard that is blocked for and the ability to break any arm tackle. He is a starting NFL RB that can immediately be a pro bowler.

take: Johnson is a very impressive RB. He’s got good size and great vision and patience that resulted in great stats his final year. He’s not the top tier athlete that will go round 1 but he should be a starting NFL RB.

cons: Hot head, not much poise. Too many fumbles. Not the top tier athlete of an elite back. Seems to not have the stamina to play all game.

pros: null
cons: Not an overly powerful back that runs through contact. Not a very aggressive runner. Doesn’t have special acceleration or burst.
take: Neal is a solid runner that excels in one on one matchups and making a guy miss. He has the top tier change of direction to break ankles but he’s missing the juice of top tier RB. He can be a solid rotational piece in a NFL backfield.
RB Dylan Sampson Tennessee 73
size: *5'11 201, NA arms, NA hands.

cons: One year of being the starter. Fumbles too much. Tennessee has a very spread out non NFL type offense. Smaller RB. Not a physical runner that easily breaks tackles.
take: Sampson is a smaller back but he makes up for it with his athleticism. He doesn’t have the power to be a top tier RB but he has enough strength to be mixed in a RB rotation and a good 2.
RB Bhayshul Tuten Virginia Tech 72
size: 5'9 205, NA arms, NA hands.

pros: Elite track runner, 7.03 60 meter. Makes defenders miss well. Runs very hard, feet churn through contact. Solid build, has good mass behind him. Great acceleration. Good patience and vision.
cons: Not a highly rated recruit with the early in career pedigree. 9 fumbles in 2023 and 2024, could have an issue. Doesn’t have great agility, more of a linear RB. Not a great receiver, hands are below average. Bad pass blocker, missed assignments and not physical blocking.
take: Tuten is a hard running strong and fast RB. He has the tools to be an NFL RB, but he lacks the 3rd down ability to be an every down back. He could start in the NFL but will probably find his way to a backup or committee role.
RB Lequint Allen Syracuse 72

cons: Vision is questionable, doesn’t make the best reads. Not a quick back that will make defenders whiff. Only a solid athlete.
take: Allen is a downhill runner that runs with great physicality. He’s not looking to avoid contact ever, but that sometimes is to his detriment. He wont be an elusive back that hits the home runs, just a solid back that can do a bit of everything.

info: 21 years old. 4-star recruit, out of Jennings High School in LA, where he rushed for 2,455 yards and 34 touchdowns. At Florida, he played for two seasons, rushing for 1,472 yards and 14 touchdowns. He also contributed 30 receptions for 238 yards and 1 touchdown.

He transferred to Georgia in 2024, where he rushed for 609 yards and 9 touchdowns, helping lead the Bulldogs to a New Year's Six bowl game and earning Third Team All-SEC honors.
pros: Produced as an 18 year old true freshman. Really good vision and patience. Great acceleration. Solid at forcing missed tackles. Good power and quickness combo.
cons: DUI. Not the biggest back, can’t run through LBs. Long speed isn’t impressive. Never was a lead back.
take: Etienne didn’t get the speed of his brother and wont go as high in the draft. But you can tell he has the vision of a top NFL back and the acceleration to capitalize on the blocking. He may not be the most physically talented but he’s going to be a solid NFL RB.
