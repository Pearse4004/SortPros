stat: 92 receptions 1,152 yards 14 TDs, 88.3 RECV 3.2% drop 68.8% contested
info: 23 years old. Hunter was the top dog coming out of Collins Hill in GA where he was the number 1 HS recruit in 2022. Surprisingly he followed Deion Sanders to Jackson State over all power 5 teams. He dominated there mostly at CB before following Sanders again to Colorado to build that program.

pros: Former number 1 recruit, very talented. 2 way player both at a high level. Elite with the ball in his hands making people miss. Great speed. Great acceleration. Very reliable hands. Elite quickness and agility. Great ball skills. Feet are quick.
cons: Because he’s playing both ways some reps off. Not a very refined WR, still has work to do. Thin frame, should add some mass, unsure of handling physicality.
take: Hunter is one of the most talented players ever in college football. He’s dominate at 2 positions because he’s an elite athlete. He has the rare ball skills to go along with his athleticism as well making him a potential hall of fame player.

cons: Not an elite freaky athlete. Pass rush isn’t elite. Doesn’t have great length.
take: Graham is an elite DL, he’s a dominant run stopper and a good pass rusher. He has great block destruction where people can’t block him and he can hold up on double teams. He will be at worst a good starter.

size: *6'2 202, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

take: Campbell was a NFL ready tackle prospect at a very young age. He has the natural power to help in the run game to go along with the high level pass pro that is needed in a tackle. He plays very in control and with good technique, that will serve him well as an instant starter in the NFL.
RB Ashton Jeanty Boise St 86
size: *5'8 215, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT

He committed to Boise St where he made an immediate impact rushing for 821 yards as a 18 year old. He followed that up with a 1,300 yard receiver even with splitting time with George Holani. He finished his college career with one of the best season a RB has had in college football.
pros: Great receiver, featured part of the game and a former WR. Good vision. Good athlete, solid change of direction and acceleration. Great contact balance. Good combination of power and speed in space. Ultra productive.
cons: Fumbles too many times. Played against lower level competition. Very short, no length to his game.
take: Jeanty is one of the better running backs coming out of college over the last few years. He has a blend of power and speed along with great vision which allows him to rack up massive numbers. He’s not the biggest or fastest RB so he won't be a top 5 pick but he’s as good as a prospect gets.
WR Luther Burden Missouri 82
size: *5'11 208, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 61 receptions 676 yards 6 TDs, 80.7 RECV 4.7% drop 50% contested
info: 21 years old. Burden was the guy at East St Louis HS, he was the max preps player of the year and a consensus 5 star recruit. He committed to Missouri where he immediately started 10 games. His real breakout happened in 2023 where he had over 1,200 receiving yards and was named All SEC and 2nd team all american. He had a drop off in production in his final season though.
pros: Great with the ball in his hands, becomes a RB. Great acceleration after the catch. Great deceleration out of top speed. Flashes nice moves to get hands off him down the field. Good speed, can get vertical. Solid at catching through contact. Good hands.
cons: Played most of his snaps in the slot. Not good at dealing with physicality at the line of scrimmage. Not much nuance to his routes.
take: Burden is electric with the ball in his hands, he’s a threat to score every time he gets it. He’s very fast and has good physicality to break tackles. He’s not the most refined WR, but he has the natural hands and athleticism to get there.
QB Shedeur Sanders Colorado 80
size: *6'2 215, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

He played well in his first season at Colorado, getting HM All Pac 12 behind Penix and Nix.
pros: Great at the quarterback position, great mechanics. Decent athlete, can move a bit to extend plays. Great accuracy. Good decision maker and processor. Understands matchups and gives his guys chances.
cons: Takes too many sacks. Arm strength is nothing special. Not much of a playmaker, doesn’t make stuff happen by himself. Trys to be a hero to often with his legs.
take: Sanders is a modern day prototypical QB, He’s got the needed athleticism but he really excels in the pocket. He makes good decisions and has a great ability to place the ball where he wants it. He’s not the top tier playmaker 1st overall picks are but he is a very good QB.
OT Wyatt Milum West Virginia 77
size: *6'6 312, NA arms, NA hands.

info: Milum was the top rated recruit from West Virginia and stayed close to home committing to West Virginia. He started 8 games as a true freshman at RT and was named a Freshman All American. He then switched to LT for 2022 and beyond where he was the full time starter the rest of his career grading out well and being named 1st team All Academic.
pros: 5 star top recruit. Very experienced Tackle. Started as a true freshman and played solid. Played both LT and RT in career. Solid athlete at size. Solid anchor. Wins his reps more often than not. Solid aggression in the run game, high effort.
cons: Off balance too often. Drops his head on contact too much. Bad hands in pass pro, doesn’t throw punches well. Slow to get hat across defenders. Usually wins ugly.
take: Milum is a solid lineman that has the physical tools and aggression to be a starting NFL OL. He needs work though, his hands and feet aren’t going to allow him to start right away. He should be drafted and developed and could turn into a solid starter.
RB Kaleb Johnson Iowa 77
size: *6'0 225, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 240 attempts 1,535 yards 21 TDs 0 Fum, 87.5 RUN 64.4 RECV 66 MFT
info: 21 years old. 3 star recruit out of Hamilton OH.
pros: Massive final year or production and solid as a true freshman. Top tier vision, always makes the most of the blocking. Doesn’t get tackled easily. Good size. Patient and sets up blocks well.
cons: Not an elite athlete. Doesn’t make any really quick moves to change direction. One year of starting.
take: Johnson is a very impressive RB. He’s got good size and great vision and patience that resulted in great stats his final year. He’s not the top tier athlete that will go round 1 but he should be a starting NFL RB.
S Jonas Sanker Virginia 77
size: *6'1 210, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 73 tackles 1 INT 5 PBU, 70.1 RDEF 75.4 TACK 71.2 COV
info: 3 star recruit out of Covenant in Charlottesville VA.
pros: 2 time All ACC 1st team. Good positioning in zone coverage. Good burst to close distance quickly. Can cover in man. Good open field tackler. Good size. Team captain.
cons: Can get fooled by backfield action and being over aggressive. Wasn’t a day 1 starter.
take: Sanker is a very good safety prospect. He’s got good size, athleticism, and has played at a high level for the last 2 years. He can play in the NFL right now and be a starter.
OT Marcus Mbow Purdue 76
size: *6'5 300, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 1,863 career snaps 21 pressures, 75.9 RBLK 73 PBLK
info: 22 years old. 3 star recruit out of Wauwatosa East in Milwaukee WI.
pros: 3 year starter at guard and tackle with grades in the 70s. Good athlete, moves well in space. Solid power to the run game, works hard. Solid length. Fast feet. Finishes blocks well.
cons: Very grabby, hands outside of the defenders frame a lot. On the thinner side, anchor may be a problem. Hate his stance, too narrow. Leans and is off balance too often.
take: Mbow has the physical tools to be a starting NFL OT. He flashes really good moments of aggression and athleticism, but its inconsistent. He needs to refine his technique and fundamentals but if he does he’s a good OT.
QB Cam Ward Miami 76
size: *6'1 223, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 39 TD 7 INT 4,313 yards 67.2%, 91.2 PASS 77.8 RUN 28 BTT 17 TWP
info: 23 Years old. 0 star recruit out of Columbia in West Columbia TX.
pros: Well-built frame, good amount of mass on him. Can throw off platform and from different angles. Good athlete, can scramble and extend plays as well as run the ball. Nice quick release. Throws with good anticipation. Very experienced QB. Makes plays happen out of structure.
cons: On the shorter side of quarterbacks. Only one year where he really stood out. Lazy on reps. Fumbling issues. Arm isn’t at a plus NFL level.
take: Ward had a great final year of college where he lead Miami to their best season in a long time. He has some good physical tools to go with with 5 years of starting experience. He’s not the perfect prospect but should get a shot to start in the NFL and can easily be a good backup.
EDGE Antwaun Powell-Ryland Virginia Tech 75
size: *6'3 252, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

pros: 3 straight years of plus pass rushing. Great get off, very quick. Productive pass rusher. Explosive edge rusher with good burst. Good hands while pass rushing. Good stunting edge pass rusher. Plays good technique in the run game.
cons: Not a long edge rusher. Couldn’t get on the field much at Florida early in his career. Wont be a stout run defender because of his size.
take: Powell-Ryland is an excellent college edge rusher that can play in the NFL. He has the technique to rush the passer and play the run at the next level. He just doesn’t have the prototypical size of an edge rusher that goes early.
QB Jaxson Dart Ole Miss 75
size: *6'2 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 29 TD 6 INT 4,276 yards 69.2%, 91.7 PASS 75 RUN 32 BTT 14 TWP

pros: Has arm talent, solid strength and accuracy. Solid athleticism, moves well. Throws well off platform. Can run the ball effectively. Improved 4 straight years. Started 4 years in the SEC and PAC 12. High Big time throw percentage.
cons: Heel clicky, base needs to be better. Lack of anticipation, doesn’t throw before the break. Inconsistent accuracy because of feet. Likes to hit the primary target mostly. Unsure of his decision making for the NFL level.
take: Dart is a talented QB that has everything you need in an NFL QB physically. He’s built well and has nice athleticism to him with a solid arm, but mentally he doesn’t have the best tape. He likes to lock on his number one and his feet need reworking.
QB Jalen Milroe Alabama 75
size: *6'2 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 16 TD 11 INT 2,836 yards 63.3%, 77.1 PASS 82.2 RUN 18 BTT 10 TWP
info: 22 years old. 4 star recruit out of Katy TX where he flipped his commitment from Texas to Bama. He backed up Bryce young as a freshman and sophomore. He took over the starting job in 2023 leading the tide to the CFP and was named 2nd team All SEC.
pros: Top tier running for a QB, great athlete. Willing to take shots in the pocket. Nice powerful quick release. Solid anticipation. Flashes of great deep balls.
cons: Inconsistent accuracy. Not a high level reading the field and decision making. Fumbling issues.
take: Milroe is an elite athlete with a solid arm to go along with it. He’s lacking the accuracy and isn’t currently a high level processor at the QB position. He’s got all the potential in the world but has work to get to a good NFL starter.
RB Treveyon Henderson Ohio St 75
size: *5'10 208, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
info: 22 years old. Henderson was the top RB recruit in the country coming out of Hopewell VA where he was dominate. He ran for over 4000 yards in his career and earned himself VA Gatorade PoY in 2019-2020. He commited to OSU where he immediately made an impact and rushed for 1,248 yards as a true freshman. The next two years he didn’t eclipse the 1k yard mark causing him to come back and team up with Judkins to make the best backfield in the country.
pros: Came in as a true freshman and dominated. Not many fumbles in his career, protects the ball. Solid production in the pass game, can block and receive. Low center of gravity, plays with good pad level. Solid burst. Plays well in a phone booth, makes people miss in tight space.
cons: Has delt with injuries that reduced his production after his freshman year. Not an elite athlete, won't break any pursuit angles. Not an overpowering or overwhelming RB, not physically special.
take: Henderson is a very good running back that is good in all aspects of the position. He is great in a phone booth where he can maneuver around defenders and show off his strength and agility. Injuries have been an issue in the past and may have hurt his speed a bit, but he can be a starting NFL RB.
S Hunter Wohler Wisconsin 75
size: *6'2 218, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 61 tackles 0 INT 6 PBU, 74 RDEF 73.7 TACK 66.7 COV
info: 22 years old. 4 star prospect out of Muskego Wisconsin.
pros: Had an elite 2023 season with an 89 PFF grade. Played all over the defense, versatile safety. Good tackler, physical and sound. Good size.
cons: Drop off in play from 2023 to 2024. Coverage is only ok, not going to be great as a deep safety. Not a top tier athlete in space.
take: Wohler is a good in the box safety, he has the size and tackling ability to start in the NFL. He’s not a very good deep safety, his lack of movement skills will not allow him to be a top tier safety in coverage.
OT Jack Nelson Wisconsin 74
size: *6'7 316, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 3,191 career snaps 7 pressures, 70.7 RBLK 83.5 PBLK
info: 5 star recruit out of Stoughton Wisconsin.
pros: 4 year starter, over 3000 career snaps. High pedigree recruit. Wisconsin OL. Solid pass sets, good positioning. Good hands, refits and strikes well.
cons: Not an overly physical OL. Doesn’t move DL in the run game. Feet aren’t that quick. Slow to recover from being beat.
take: Nelson didn’t truly live up to the 5 star hype he had out of HS, he’s not athletically gifted enough to be a highly sought after OT. He’s played 4 very good seasons for the badgers and can play in the NFL.
WR Nick Nash San Jose St 74
size: *6'3 195, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 104 receptions 1,382 yards 16 TDs, 86.1 RECV 6.3% drop 50% contested
info: NA
pros: Huge final year, won the triple crown. Very good at catching the ball outside his frame. Can climb up the ladder to catch the ball. Solid routes, good ability to break down at his size.
cons: 6 years of college with 1 elite year of production. Played a lot of slot but will be a true X in the NFL. Not a very fast downfield threat. Doesn’t add much with the ball in his hands.
take: Nash reminds me of Mike Evans with his ability to high point and the way he runs routes. He probably can’t emulate Evan’s physicality and speed which is why hes not a 1st round type guy. It’s concerning that it took him 6 years but he showed he can play at a high level in 2024.
QB Kurtis Rourke Indiana 73
size: *6'5 223, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 29 TD 5 INT 3,042 yards 68.9%, 90.2 PASS 46.7 RUN 19 BTT 10 TWP
info: 24 years old. 2 star top recruit out of Holy Trinity in Canada. Brother of Ohio legend Nathan Rourke.
pros: Played a full season on a torn ACL and led Indiana to a great season. Good size. Good touch throws and accuracy. 4 years of good starting experience. Flashes reading full field. Throws with anticipation.
cons: One year of Power 4 play. A lot of sacks senior year. College offense full of screens and RPOs. Has to get ACL surgery. Arm isn’t very strong. Too many fumbles.
take: Rourke may have gone high in the draft if he hadn’t torn his ACL before the year. He’s a smart and accurate QB with good size. His lack of mobility in his film from 2024 makes it hard to project him as a starter but once he heals he could get a shot.
RB Devin Neal Kansas 73
size: *5’11 215, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
info: 21 years old. Neal was the top recruit coming out of Kansas and decided to stay close to home going to the university of Kansas. He immediately got playing time as a true freshman running for 700 yards. He followed it up by rushing for 1000+ yards in 2022, 2023 and 2024. He now holds the All Time rushing records for Kansas.
pros: Team captain. Good production every year of his career. Top tier vision. Solid pass catcher, good hands. Good short area movement, makes very quick cuts. Has a knack for side stepping tacklers. Patient runner, waits for blocks to develop.
cons: Not an overly powerful back that runs through contact. Not a very aggressive runner. Doesn’t have special acceleration or burst.
take: Neal is a solid runner that excels in one on one matchups and making a guy miss. He has the top tier change of direction to break ankles but he’s missing the juice of top tier RB. He can be a solid rotational piece in a NFL backfield.
S Jerrin Thompson Auburn 73
size: *6'0 186, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 52 tackles 2 INT 3 PBU, 68.6 RDEF 78.1 TACK 76.6 COV

pros: Team captain. Experienced defensive back against top tier competition. Smart and instinctive player. Stays in good position and doesn’t get beat often. Versatile, played all over the field.
cons: Not the biggest safety, may struggle with physicality in the NFL.
take: Thompson is a good football player that can do a little of everything. He’s a team captain, played all over the field and started for 4 seasons. He’s not physically imposing which will limit him but he should end up playing in the NFL.
QB Carson Beck Georgia 72
size: *6'4 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 28 TD 12 INT 3,466 yards 64.6%, 80.2 PASS 62.2 RUN 23 BTT 20 TWP

pros: Starting QB for powerhouse program. Gets the ball out fast and on target. Plays very well in rhythm, looks the part. Throws with great touch. Works the pocket well. Works to his checkdown well. Good footwork. Solid at intermediate throws.
cons: Too many fumbles. Not an overpowering arm, just average. Doesn’t make many plays happen on his own. Not a plus runner. Drop off in play from 23-24.
take: Beck is a very good quarterback that can run an offense at a NFL level. He’s smart, accurate, and refined with solid size and arm strength. He can’t take an offense to a higher level, he’s not a playmaker which will limit his draft ceiling.
RB RJ Harvey UCF 72
size: *5'9 208, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 231 attempts 1,578 yards 22 TDs 2 Fum, 89.9 RUN 62.7 RECV 68 MFT
info: No star recruit out of Edgewater in Orlando FL where he played QB. Played 1 year at Virginia where he read shirted and transferred to UCF.
pros: Team captain. Back to back 1,400+ yard seasons. Good burst. Solid open field speed. Solid size. Runs hard and through contact. Good short area quickness and shake.
cons: Older RB that didn’t break out until his 4th year. Not a good pass protector. Not a power back, wont be running through NFL LBs. Can get caught dancing in the backfield.
take: Harvey may not be the biggest RB but he has built a very impressive resume. He was very productive thanks to his good vision and very good quickness. He has experience being a work horse and may be able to continue that at the next level if given the opportunity.
RB Bhayshul Tuten Virginia Tech 72
size: *5'11 209, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
info: Tuten was a no star recruit that got his start at NC A&T after his HS playing days in NJ. He had a breakout sophomore year in 2022 with 1,300 rush yards and averaging 6.6 a pop. He transferred to VT and immediately became the starter. He made a name for himself and showed out the second half of 2023.
pros: Elite track runner, 7.03 60 meter. Makes defenders miss well. Runs very hard, feet churn through contact. Solid build, has good mass behind him. Great acceleration. Good patience and vision.
cons: Not a highly rated recruit with the early in career pedigree. 9 fumbles in 2023 and 2024, could have an issue. Doesn’t have great agility, more of a linear RB. Not a great receiver, hands are below average. Bad pass blocker, missed assignments and not physical blocking.
take: Tuten is a hard running strong and fast RB. He has the tools to be an NFL RB, but he lacks the 3rd down ability to be an every down back. He could start in the NFL but will probably find his way to a backup or committee role.
QB Tyler Shough Louisville 71
size: *6'5 225, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 23 TD 6 INT 3,191 yards 62.1%, 88.6 PASS 56 RUN 22 BTT 8 TWP
info: 25 years old. 4 star recruit out of Hamilton in Chandler AZ. He has played for 3 programs, including Oregon, Texas Tech, and Lousiville.
pros: Experienced QB, 7 years of football and 3 programs. His only year of starting every game was very productive. Good size. Solid mobility. Throws with good touch.
cons: 7 years of college football and only made it through 1 full season with no injuries. Had trouble keeping the starting job early in his career. Doesn’t embrace contact in the pocket. Throw power is not impressive. Not agile at all, pocket movements and cuts in space are not quick.
take: Shough is a lot like Tanner Mckee in play style and background. Both have good size, recruiting profiles and physical abilities but injuries and lack of production drop down his stock. Shough seems like he can be a top tier backup.
QB Mark Gronowski South Dakota 71
size: *6'3 225, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

cons: Low level of competition in the FCS. Low completion percentage his senior year. Struggles with accuracy on touch throws.

take: Asante is a physical player that will hold up to NFL athleticism. He’s an older prospect that doesn’t react as quick as you would hope a very experienced LB would. He can be a good special teams player and fill in on defense.

cons: One year of production. Not a sudden back. Change of direction is not good. Vision is middle of the road.

cons: Didn’t live up to his hype from HS. A little slow to make decisions. Missing the precision on his passes, slightly inaccurate. Arm isn’t impressive. Disappointing senior year.
take: Uiagalelei looks the part, he’s got great size and a solid arm with athleticism. He also plays the position pretty well, he has been coached well. But he’s a little underwhelming, he’s slow in everything he does whether that be diagnosing or getting the ball out. He can be a backup in the NFL, but it looks like that's it.

pros: Big strong QB, has great size and strength to play QB. Throws from a solid base, good feet. Good athlete, can be a designed run game QB.
cons: Long time to throw and takes a high percentage of sacks. Eyes down and run when any pressure arrives, needs to keep his eyes up. Not accurate, misses throws constantly. Doesn’t see the field well, locks in to one receiver. Slow release, takes a bit to set feet and let it go.
take: Jefferson is a big strong QB that has had a lot of success at Arkansas. He’s lacking the arm talent to get him drafted early but he has the body type and athletic ability to play in the NFL.

cons: Couldn’t get many reps when Blake Corum was there. Vision is only ok. Not a powerful back. Doesn’t break many tackles.

cons: Didn’t improve much on stats or grades over the 4 years of starting. Doesn’t have plus arm strength. Accuracy is middle of the road. Average athlete, can’t be in the run game. Losing final season.
take: Thorne looks the part at QB, he clearly has been training his whole life to play the position. He’s smart, experienced, and has enough tools to be a plus college QB. Translating to the next level may be tough given he has no trump card physically. He would most likely be a career backup if he makes it in the league.
