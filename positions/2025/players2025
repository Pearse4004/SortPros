take: Sanders is a modern day prototypical QB, He’s got the needed athleticism but he really excels in the pocket. He makes good decisions and has a great ability to place the ball where he wants it. He’s not the top tier playmaker 1st overall picks are but he is a very good QB.

info: 22 years old. 4-star recruit out of Darton High School in Starkville, MS. He started his career at USC, where he played in 2021 before transferring to Ole Miss in 2022. Dart quickly became the starting quarterback for the Rebels, passing for 2,974 yards, 20 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions in his first season at Ole Miss. In 2024, Dart built on that success, throwing for 4,276 yards, 29 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions, while leading Ole Miss to an 11-2 record, earning 1st-team All-SEC honors.
pros: Has arm talent, solid strength and accuracy. Solid athleticism, moves well. Throws well off platform. Can run the ball effectively. Improved 4 straight years. Started 4 years in the SEC and PAC 12. High Big time throw percentage.
cons: Heel clicky, base needs to be better. Lack of anticipation, doesn’t throw before the break. Inconsistent accuracy because of feet. Likes to hit the primary target mostly. Unsure of his decision making for the NFL level.
take: Dart is a talented QB that has everything you need in an NFL QB physically. He’s built well and has nice athleticism to him with a solid arm, but mentally he doesn’t have the best tape. He likes to lock on his number one and his feet need reworking.
QB Jalen Milroe Alabama 76

cons: Inconsistent accuracy. Not a high level reading the field and decision making. Fumbling issues.
take: Milroe is an elite athlete with a solid arm to go along with it. He’s lacking the accuracy and isn’t currently a high level processor at the QB position. He’s got all the potential in the world but has work to get to a good NFL starter.

cons: Only one year of 1000+ yards. Not very big. Will struggle between the tackles in the NFL.
take: James is a slightly tuned down Jamyr Gibbs. He will struggle with being a work horse but as a change of pace back he is electric.
RB Ollie Gordon Oklahoma St 76

pros: Lead NCAA in rushing in 2023. Dominated the big 12 as a 19 year old. Solid receiving production. Solid at breaking tackles, defenders slide off him. Good speed, can run away especially for size. Solid stiff arm. Good vision.
cons: Drop off in 2024. Taller back, center of gravity higher than you like. Not explosive with his cuts.
take: Gordon is a very productive back with good size and speed. He’s got the rare combination that will allow him to have a successful NFL career as a starting RB.

cons: Not a long edge rusher. Couldn’t get on the field much at Florida early in his career. Wont be a stout run defender because of his size.
take: Powell-Ryland is an excellent college edge rusher that can play in the NFL. He has the technique to rush the passer and play the run at the next level. He just doesn’t have the prototypical size of an edge rusher that goes early.
OT Marcus Mbow Purdue 75
size: *6'5 300, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: 22 years old. 3 star recruit out of Wauwatosa East in Milwaukee WI.
pros: 3 year starter at guard and tackle with grades in the 70s. Good athlete, moves well in space. Solid power to the run game, works hard. Solid length. Fast feet. Finishes blocks well.
cons: Very grabby, hands outside of the defenders frame a lot. On the thinner side, anchor may be a problem. Hate his stance, too narrow. Leans and is off balance too often.
take: Mbow has the physical tools to be a starting NFL OT. He flashes really good moments of aggression and athleticism, but its inconsistent. He needs to refine his technique and fundamentals but if he does he’s a good OT.
QB Cam Ward Miami 75
size: *6'1 223, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

pros: Well-built frame, good amount of mass on him. Can throw off platform and from different angles. Good athlete, can scramble and extend plays as well as run the ball. Nice quick release. Throws with good anticipation. Very experienced QB. Makes plays happen out of structure.
cons: On the shorter side of quarterbacks. Only one year where he really stood out. Lazy on reps. Fumbling issues. Arm isn’t at a plus NFL level.
take: Ward had a great final year of college where he lead Miami to their best season in a long time. He has some good physical tools to go with with 5 years of starting experience. He’s not the perfect prospect but should get a shot to start in the NFL and can easily be a good backup.
QB Kyle McCord Syracuse 75
size: 6'3 224, 31 1/4 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

Pushes the ball down the field well. Solid zip on his passes. Can go through progression and work the ball to a check down.
cons: Had a loaded OSU team in 2023 and wasn’t dominant. Poor decision maker, lapses in judgment and forces to ball to his first read. Doesn’t scramble, needs to pick up easy yards with his legs. Wouldn’t be classified as a playmaker.
take: McCord would be classified as a good game manager, he’s not the QB to come in and take over games. The issue is he makes a lot of weird decisions where he can’t come off his first read and puts the ball in harms way. He’s a talented QB with solid size and a NFL arm, but he doesn’t lift a team like top picks do.
RB Tahj Brooks Texas Tech 75
size: 5'9 229, 30 3/4 arms, 9 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 287 attempts 1,512 yards 17 TDs 2 Fum, 85.4 RUN 58.2 RECV 59 MFT
info: 23 years old. Brooks was a solid 3-star recruit with a lot of offers coming out of Manor, TX. He stayed close to home and chose Texas Tech, where he got playing time as a true freshman. Over the next 2 years, he led the team in rushing but didn’t produce like a top back. That all changed in 2023 when he broke out in a big way, rushing for over 1,500 yards. In 2024, Brooks earned 1st-team All-Big 12 honors, rushing for 1,269 yards and 16 touchdowns.
pros: Unbelievable 2023 season with 1500 yards and 96 MTF. Low center of gravity with good pad level. Great at forcing missed tackles. Runs hard. Good patience. Solid burt and agility on jump cuts.
cons: Took him 4 years to really break out. Not much of a speedster. Not much experience receiving out of the back field.
take: Brooks is a hard nosed physical runner that has the skills to be a starting NFL RB. He has the Javonte Williams I wont go down trait and he’s extremely hard to tackle.

info: 22 years old. 4 star prospect out of Muskego Wisconsin.
pros: Had an elite 2023 season with an 89 PFF grade. Played all over the defense, versatile safety. Good tackler, physical and sound. Good size.
cons: Drop off in play from 2023 to 2024. Coverage is only ok, not going to be great as a deep safety. Not a top tier athlete in space.
take: Wohler is a good in the box safety, he has the size and tackling ability to start in the NFL. He’s not a very good deep safety, his lack of movement skills will not allow him to be a top tier safety in coverage.

In his first season at Tennessee, he tallied 52 receptions for 667 yards and four touchdowns, contributing to the team's 11–2 record and victory in the Orange Bowl. In 2023, he suffered a season-ending ankle injury after accumulating 17 receptions for 217 yards and one touchdown over five games. Returning in 2024, McCoy led the Volunteers with 35 receptions, surpassing 100 career catches, and was recognized as a Jason Witten Collegiate Man of the Year semifinalist.
pros: High pedigree. Built to be an NFL player. Great speed on tape. Good subtle moves to separate. Can make plays with the ball. Good out of breaks. Good catch radius.
cons: Disappointing career production. Weird Tennessee offense. Old prospect that never dominated.

stat: 3,191 career snaps 7 pressures, 70.7 RBLK 83.5 PBLK
info: 5 star recruit out of Stoughton Wisconsin.
pros: 4 year starter, over 3000 career snaps. High pedigree recruit. Wisconsin OL. Solid pass sets, good positioning. Good hands, refits and strikes well.
cons: Not an overly physical OL. Doesn’t move DL in the run game. Feet aren’t that quick. Slow to recover from being beat.
take: Nelson didn’t truly live up to the 5 star hype he had out of HS, he’s not athletically gifted enough to be a highly sought after OT. He’s played 4 very good seasons for the badgers and can play in the NFL.
QB Riley Leonard Notre Dame 74

Good short area movement, makes very quick cuts. Has a knack for side stepping tacklers. Patient runner, waits for blocks to develop.
pros: null
cons: Not an overly powerful back that runs through contact. Not a very aggressive runner. Doesn’t have special acceleration or burst.
take: Neal is a solid runner that excels in one on one matchups and making a guy miss. He has the top tier change of direction to break ankles but he’s missing the juice of top tier RB. He can be a solid rotational piece in a NFL backfield.
RB Dylan Sampson Tennessee 73
size: *5'11 201, NA arms, NA hands.

pros: Elite final year, named SEC OPOY. Young RB, only 20 years old. Good speed. Good patience. Can slip through small openings in the defense.
cons: One year of being the starter. Fumbles too much. Tennessee has a very spread out non NFL type offense. Smaller RB. Not a physical runner that easily breaks tackles.
take: Sampson is a smaller back but he makes up for it with his athleticism. He doesn’t have the power to be a top tier RB but he has enough strength to be mixed in a RB rotation and a good 2.

pros: Team captain. Experienced defensive back against top tier competition. Smart and instinctive player. Stays in good position and doesn’t get beat often. Versatile, played all over the field.
cons: Not the biggest safety, may struggle with physicality in the NFL.
take: Thompson is a good football player that can do a little of everything. He’s a team captain, played all over the field and started for 4 seasons. He’s not physically imposing which will limit him but he should end up playing in the NFL.
WR Nick Nash San Jose St 73

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 104 receptions 1,382 yards 16 TDs, 86.1 RECV 6.3% drop 50% contested
info: NA
pros: Huge final year, won the triple crown. Very good at catching the ball outside his frame. Can climb up the ladder to catch the ball. Solid routes, good ability to break down at his size.
cons: 6 years of college with 1 elite year of production. Played a lot of slot but will be a true X in the NFL. Not a very fast downfield threat. Doesn’t add much with the ball in his hands.
take: Nash reminds me of Mike Evans with his ability to high point and the way he runs routes. He probably can’t emulate Evan’s physicality and speed which is why hes not a 1st round type guy. It’s concerning that it took him 6 years but he showed he can play at a high level in 2024.

cons: One year of Power 4 play. A lot of sacks senior year. College offense full of screens and RPOs. Has to get ACL surgery. Arm isn’t very strong. Too many fumbles.
take: Rourke may have gone high in the draft if he hadn’t torn his ACL before the year. He’s a smart and accurate QB with good size. His lack of mobility in his film from 2024 makes it hard to project him as a starter but once he heals he could get a shot.

take: Harvey may not be the biggest RB but he has built a very impressive resume. He was very productive thanks to his good vision and very good quickness. He has experience being a work horse and may be able to continue that at the next level if given the opportunity.
RB Bhayshul Tuten Virginia Tech 72
size: 5'9 205, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

pros: Elite track runner, 7.03 60 meter. Makes defenders miss well. Runs very hard, feet churn through contact. Solid build, has good mass behind him. Great acceleration. Good patience and vision.
cons: Not a highly rated recruit with the early in career pedigree. 9 fumbles in 2023 and 2024, could have an issue. Doesn’t have great agility, more of a linear RB. Not a great receiver, hands are below average. Bad pass blocker, missed assignments and not physical blocking.
take: Tuten is a hard running strong and fast RB. He has the tools to be an NFL RB, but he lacks the 3rd down ability to be an every down back. He could start in the NFL but will probably find his way to a backup or committee role.
RB Lequint Allen Syracuse 72

pros: Runs behind his pads, great power and physicality. Strong runner, runs feet through tacklers. Great gap scheme power runner. Good hands, can go out wide.
cons: Vision is questionable, doesn’t make the best reads. Not a quick back that will make defenders whiff. Only a solid athlete.
take: Allen is a downhill runner that runs with great physicality. He’s not looking to avoid contact ever, but that sometimes is to his detriment. He wont be an elusive back that hits the home runs, just a solid back that can do a bit of everything.

take: Shough is a lot like Tanner Mckee in play style and background. Both have good size, recruiting profiles and physical abilities but injuries and lack of production drop down his stock. Shough seems like he can be a top tier backup.

cons: Didn’t produce a ton at alabama state and had to pump his numbers up the last 2 games at New Mexico. Can dance a little too much in the backfield. Not a powerful runner, wont be trucking anyone soon.
take: Croskey-Merritt is an extremely talented back with great athleticism and effort. The question is why was he underachieving until last few years. If a team picks him up he could be a home run pick.

take: Asante is a physical player that will hold up to NFL athleticism. He’s an older prospect that doesn’t react as quick as you would hope a very experienced LB would. He can be a good special teams player and fill in on defense.

cons: Bad attitude at the elite 11. Thinner frame. Plays with no sense of urgency. Don’t see many high level reads and progressions. Turnover issues.
take: Ewers is a talented passer that has high level arm talent. He is accurate and can push the ball down the field.

take: Uiagalelei looks the part, he’s got great size and a solid arm with athleticism. He also plays the position pretty well, he has been coached well. But he’s a little underwhelming, he’s slow in everything he does whether that be diagnosing or getting the ball out. He can be a backup in the NFL, but it looks like that's it.

info: 24 years old. 3-star recruit out of Arrowhead High School in Hartland, WI. Thorne began his collegiate career at Michigan State, where he started for three seasons, passing for over 6,000 yards and 49 touchdowns. He transferred to Auburn for the 2024 season, where he earned the starting quarterback role. Thorne passed for 2,713 yards, 21 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions in his first season at Auburn.
pros: Team captain and a coach's son. Played consistently solid football over the course of 4 years. Very experienced QB. Smart player, keeps the ball out of harms way and works through progressions. Works in the pocket very well, protects the ball and avoids rushers.
cons: Didn’t improve much on stats or grades over the 4 years of starting. Doesn’t have plus arm strength. Accuracy is middle of the road. Average athlete, can’t be in the run game. Losing final season.
take: Thorne looks the part at QB, he clearly has been training his whole life to play the position. He’s smart, experienced, and has enough tools to be a plus college QB. Translating to the next level may be tough given he has no trump card physically. He would most likely be a career backup if he makes it in the league.
