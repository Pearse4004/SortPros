test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 92 receptions 1,152 yards 14 TDs, 88.3 RECV 3.2% drop 68.8% contested
info: 23 years old. Hunter was the top dog coming out of Collins Hill in GA where he was the number 1 HS recruit in 2022. Surprisingly he followed Deion Sanders to Jackson State over all power 5 teams. He dominated there mostly at CB before following Sanders again to Colorado to build that program. He became a 2 way player showing that he is a great WR and Corner.
pros: Former number 1 recruit, very talented. 2 way player both at a high level. Elite with the ball in his hands making people miss. Great speed. Great acceleration. Very reliable hands. Elite quickness and agility. Great ball skills. Feet are quick.
cons: Because he’s playing both ways some reps off. Not a very refined WR, still has work to do. Thin frame, should add some mass, unsure of handling physicality.
take: Hunter is one of the most talented players ever in college football. He’s dominate at 2 positions because he’s an elite athlete. He has the rare ball skills to go along with his athleticism as well making him a potential hall of fame player.

pros: Very powerful at the point of attack. Has a nice bull rush. Stack and sheds great. Very hard to block, uses hands well to get OL off him. Tosses OL, has superior strength. Can hold up to double teams. As good as it gets in the run game.
cons: Not an elite freaky athlete. Pass rush isn’t elite. Doesn’t have great length.
take: Graham is an elite DL, he’s a dominant run stopper and a good pass rusher. He has great block destruction where people can’t block him and he can hold up on double teams. He will be at worst a good starter.

take: Jeanty is one of the better running backs coming out of college over the last few years. He has a blend of power and speed along with great vision which allows him to rack up massive numbers. He’s not the biggest or fastest RB so he won't be a top 5 pick but he’s as good as a prospect gets.

stat: 81 receptions 1,011 yards 10 TDs, 82.4 RECV 5.8% drop 59.1% contested
info: 22 years old. Egbuka was a 5 star receiver out of Steilacoom WA where he was the Gatorade Player of the year and the number 1 receiver recruit in the country. He joined a loaded WR room with Olave, Wilson, JSN, and MHJ so he had to wait a year to break out. That he did, in 2022 he had over 1,100 receiving yards and 74 receptions. He came back in 2023 and delt with injuries and worse QB play which drastically reduced his production.
pros: Top level recruit at OSU that was good as a true sophomore. Good size. Great acceleration off the line. Good hands, catches away from his body. Good at the top of routes, uses hands and sells routes well. Great at attacking leverage of defenders to set up breaks. Solid with the ball in his hands, gets upfield and can run through bad tackles.
cons: Doesn’t have the elite agility and quickness at the top of breaks. Unsure about his feel vs zone and finding space. Not a very good deep threat.
take: Egbuka is a polished Ohio State WR with good routes, hands, and solid athleticism. He has all the tools and ability to immediately be a starting NFL WR. The only draw back is that he’s not the elite athlete with the upside of a top 10 NFL WR.

info: 21 years old. 4 star recruit from Charlotte NC. Didn’t play as a true freshman. True sophomore breakout, 13 sacks and All SEC 1st team.
pros: Very good pass rush production. Good length. Solid power, can bull an OT with a long arm. Great athlete, closedown speed is great. Good on stunts, gets home quick. Can set an edge with his long arms.
cons: Didn’t get any playing time as a true freshman and not an every down edge as a sophomore. Thinner rusher, needs to add weight and power. No secondary moves. Not a refined pass rusher.
take: Pearce is a young athletic long rusher with sky high potential. He has a nice long arm and some elite closing speed to finish his pass rush. He still needs to develop him pass rush game and add mass to be an every down NFL starter.

He improved as a Sophomore where he became a 2nd team All American and a 1st team All Big 12 selection.
pros: Played well as a true freshman. Really nice first step in pass pro. Very good athlete, can move well in space. Solid pop to his game, can move guys when he wants. Good build, solid size and length. Great change of direction, especially in pass pro. Uses hands well in pass pro.
cons: Needs a stronger anchor. Not very aggressive in the run game. Off balance too often in the run game.
take: Banks has the potential to be an elite pass protector in the NFL. He’s got the size and moves very well for it as well as uses his hands well.  He's only missing the top level aggression and physicality that would make him a top tier prospect.

In 2024, he earned 1st-team All-ACC honors again, rushing for over 1,400 yards and 14 touchdowns.

cons: Not a juiced up elusive back, wont see him juke anyone out. Change of direction isn’t a strength.
take: Hampton is a no nonsense, physical, north and south runner. He has elite burst and power to get every yard that is blocked for and the ability to break any arm tackle. He is a starting NFL RB that can immediately be a pro bowler.

stat: 145 attempts 1,010 yards 10 TDs 0 Fum, 91.8 RUN 74.5 RECV 37 MFT
info: 22 years old. Henderson was the top RB recruit in the country coming out of Hopewell VA where he was dominate. He ran for over 4000 yards in his career and earned himself VA Gatorade PoY in 2019-2020. He commited to OSU where he immediately made an impact and rushed for 1,248 yards as a true freshman. The next two years he didn’t eclipse the 1k yard mark causing him to come back and team up with Judkins to make the best backfield in the country.
pros: Came in as a true freshman and dominated. Not many fumbles in his career, protects the ball. Solid production in the pass game, can block and receive. Low center of gravity, plays with good pad level. Good burst. Plays well in a phone booth, makes people miss in tight space. Great championship run.
cons: Has delt with injuries that reduced his production after his freshman year. Not an elite athlete, won't break any pursuit angles. Not an overpowering or overwhelming RB, not physically special.
take: Henderson is a very good running back that is good in all aspects of the position. He is great in a phone booth where he can maneuver around defenders and show off his strength and agility. Injuries have been an issue in the past and may have hurt his speed a bit, but he can be a starting NFL RB.

pros: Good size. Good career production. Very reliable hands. Great at catching away from his frame. Handles press very well, good releases. Great strength catching through contact. Good routes, sets up breaks. Body control is great, makes plays in the air. Makes DBs miss in space. Good long speed
cons: Ole Miss offense, different than the NFL. Not an elite athlete, not twitched up. Not the high pedigree out of HS that produced immediately.
take: Harris is an NFL ready X receiver right now. He’s physically built to play on the outside in the NFL and his play style aligns with that. He is elite in contested catch situations and has elite hands. He can make guys wimm with the ball and separate which will allow him to be a WR 1.

pros: Great at the quarterback position, great mechanics. Decent athlete, can move a bit to extend plays. Great accuracy. Good decision maker and processor. Understands matchups and gives his guys chances.
cons: Takes too many sacks. Arm strength is nothing special. Not much of a playmaker, doesn’t make stuff happen by himself. Trys to be a hero to often with his legs.
take: Sanders is a modern day prototypical QB, He’s got the needed athleticism but he really excels in the pocket. He makes good decisions and has a great ability to place the ball where he wants it. He’s not the top tier playmaker 1st overall picks are but he is a very good QB.

pros: Immediately started and made a massive impact in the SEC. Very productive RB. Doesn’t fumble very often. Forces a lot of missed tackles. Physical and solid enough technique to be a good blocker. Keeps legs churning to always fight for yards. Elite burst, can hit very small windows quickly. Muscular build, takes a lot to get him down. Good contact balance. Good vision and instincts.
cons: Not used as a weapon in the receiving game. Not a plus blocker as of now. Doesn’t do the best job of yards after contact, rarely breaks a tackle to create big plays.
take: Judkins is a hard running RB that has elite burst to go along with his physical running style. He has always produced at a high level and is expected to be a RB 1 immediately in the NFL.

pros: Great with the ball in his hands, becomes a RB. Great acceleration after the catch. Great deceleration out of top speed. Flashes nice moves to get hands off him down the field. Good speed, can get vertical. Solid at catching through contact. Good hands.
cons: Played most of his snaps in the slot. Not good at dealing with physicality at the line of scrimmage. Not much nuance to his routes.
take: Burden is electric with the ball in his hands, he’s a threat to score every time he gets it. He’s very fast and has good physicality to break tackles. He’s not the most refined WR, but he has the natural hands and athleticism to get there.

pros: Solid size. Can move guys in the run game. Looks like a very physically capable guard.
cons: Not the most athletic tackle, doesn't move as well as you would like. Lets guys into his chest. Pass sets are not great, turns shoulders early.
take: Simmons is a big solid athlete that excels in the run game. He can really move people but he’s a liability in pass pro on the edge. If he is kicked into guard he could be a solid NFL player.

info: 21 years old. Booker was a 4 star recruit out of IMG in FL where he was coached by a former NFL OL and was recruited by all the big schools. He chose Alabama and played both guard positions as a true freshman and was an All SEC Freshman selection. He broke out in 2023 starting every game and was an All SEC 1st team selection and a integral part of the Alabama OL.
pros: High recruit out of IMG. Great build, made in a lab. Has OT and OG versatility. Feet are always moving, carries his weight well. Good strength, solid anchoring. Good technique, solid hands and plays long. Handles stunts well.
cons: Can be lazy on reps. Needs to do a better job displacing DL in the run game. Could have a little more of a mean streak. Can get caught leaning. A little slow at tackle.
take: Booker is an extremely talented OL with great size and athleticism. He's got it all and can start in the NFL day 1. He still needs to work on some bad habits but he can be all pro if he wants.

info: 23 years old. 4-star recruit out of Columbia High School in West Columbia, TX. Ward started his career at Incarnate Word, where he set multiple program records, including a 4,648-yard, 47-touchdown season in 2021. He transferred to Washington State for the 2022 season, where he quickly became the starter, passing for over 3,200 yards and 23 touchdowns.

pros: Well-built frame, good amount of mass on him. Can throw off platform and from different angles. Good athlete, can scramble and extend plays as well as run the ball. Nice quick release. Throws with good anticipation. Very experienced QB. Makes plays happen out of structure.
cons: On the shorter side of quarterbacks. Only one year where he really stood out. Lazy on reps. Fumbling issues. Arm isn’t at a plus NFL level.
take: Ward had a great final year of college where he lead Miami to their best season in a long time. He has some good physical tools to go with with 5 years of starting experience. He’s not the perfect prospect but should get a shot to start in the NFL and can easily be a good backup.

stat: 2,933 career snaps 8 pressures, 87.5 RBLK 90.0 PBLK
info: Milum was the top rated recruit from West Virginia and stayed close to home committing to West Virginia. He started 8 games as a true freshman at RT and was named a Freshman All American. He then switched to LT for 2022 and beyond where he was the full time starter the rest of his career grading out well and being named 1st team All Academic.
pros: 5 star top recruit. Very experienced Tackle. Started as a true freshman and played solid. Played both LT and RT in career. Solid athlete at size. Solid anchor. Wins his reps more often than not. Solid aggression in the run game, high effort.
cons: Off balance too often. Drops his head on contact too much. Bad hands in pass pro, doesn’t throw punches well. Slow to get hat across defenders. Usually wins ugly.
take: Milum is a solid lineman that has the physical tools and aggression to be a starting NFL OL. He needs work though, his hands and feet aren’t going to allow him to start right away. He should be drafted and developed and could turn into a solid starter.

pros: Started as a true freshman. Got better from his first year. Good size. Loves to finish his blocks. Good athlete, can move well.
cons: Lunges too much in pass pro. Plays a little too high. Gets beat too much 1v1 in space. Can get walked back because he lets defenders in his pads.
take: Jones is a physically talented OL that is still improving. He has very good feet and a good build, but his technique is off especially in pass pro. He is over aggressive in space causing him to whiff or get off balance too often.

pros: Massive final year or production and solid as a true freshman. Top tier vision, always makes the most of the blocking. Doesn’t get tackled easily. Good size. Patient and sets up blocks well.
cons: Not an elite athlete. Doesn’t make any really quick moves to change direction. One year of starting.
take: Johnson is a very impressive RB. He’s got good size and great vision and patience that resulted in great stats his final year. He’s not the top tier athlete that will go round 1 but he should be a starting NFL RB.

take: Skattebo is a tank, he is the last guy you want to try to tackle because how physical he is. He’s nearly impossible to bring down and if he had the top tier athleticism he would be a first round back.

pros: Team captain. Multiple years of over 1k receiving yards. Smooth mover, makes cuts look easy. Solid body control, makes spinning catches easy. Good long speed. Good with the ball in his hands.
cons: Played against a lower level of comp. Acceleration is not good. No twitchyness to his game. Thinner receiver, needs to add mass. Routes aren’t special. Hurt his final year.
take: Horton is a ultra productive great college receiver. He has great ball skills and is a solid athlete to go along with it. The jump in play level and physicality will challenge him but he is an NFL WR.

stat: 1,863 career snaps 21 pressures, 75.9 RBLK 73 PBLK
info: 22 years old. 3 star recruit out of Wauwatosa East in Milwaukee WI.
pros: 3 year starter at guard and tackle with grades in the 70s. Good athlete, moves well in space. Solid power to the run game, works hard. Solid length. Fast feet. Finishes blocks well.
cons: Very grabby, hands outside of the defenders frame a lot. On the thinner side, anchor may be a problem. Hate his stance, too narrow. Leans and is off balance too often.
take: Mbow has the physical tools to be a starting NFL OT. He flashes really good moments of aggression and athleticism, but its inconsistent. He needs to refine his technique and fundamentals but if he does he’s a good OT.

info: 23 years old. No star recruit out of White Plains where he won back to back state championships. Went to Rhode Island for 3 years where he developed into a dominant OT. He was a 4 star transfer that got offers to a lot of power 5 programs. Went to Oregon to start every game at RT allowing 0 sacks.
pros: Works hard in the run game. Got the job done in pass pro, didn’t get beat too often. Moves well, good athlete.
cons: On the skinnier side, should add more mass. Pass pro hands are mediocre, doesn’t get hands on well. Sloppy looking pass pro.
take: Cornelius is a long athletic tackle that has played well in his college career. He’s on the skinnier side so he will have to build up his strength more and develop his hand technique to be a starting NFL OT.

In 2024, Dart built on that success, throwing for 4,276 yards, 29 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions, while leading Ole Miss to an 11-2 record, earning 1st-team All-SEC honors.
pros: Has arm talent, solid strength and accuracy. Solid athleticism, moves well. Throws well off platform. Can run the ball effectively. Improved 4 straight years. Started 4 years in the SEC and PAC 12. High Big time throw percentage.
cons: Heel clicky, base needs to be better. Lack of anticipation, doesn’t throw before the break. Inconsistent accuracy because of feet. Likes to hit the primary target mostly. Unsure of his decision making for the NFL level.
take: Dart is a talented QB that has everything you need in an NFL QB physically. He’s built well and has nice athleticism to him with a solid arm, but mentally he doesn’t have the best tape. He likes to lock on his number one and his feet need reworking.
QB Jalen Milroe Alabama 76
size: 6'1 223, 30 7/8 arms, 8 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 16 TD 11 INT 2,836 yards 63.3%, 77.1 PASS 82.2 RUN 18 BTT 10 TWP
info: 22 years old. 4-star recruit out of Thompson High School in Alabaster, AL, where he led his team to a state championship. Milroe committed to Alabama, where he served as a backup quarterback in his freshman season before earning the starting job in 2023. He passed for 2,839 yards, 23 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions while rushing for 806 yards and 12 touchdowns in his first season as a starter. Milroe continued to impress in 2024, throwing for 3,141 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions, and adding 879 rushing yards and 20 touchdowns.
pros: Top tier running for a QB, great athlete. Willing to take shots in the pocket. Nice powerful quick release. Solid anticipation. Flashes of great deep balls.
cons: Inconsistent accuracy. Not a high level reading the field and decision making. Fumbling issues.
take: Milroe is an elite athlete with a solid arm to go along with it. He’s lacking the accuracy and isn’t currently a high level processor at the QB position. He’s got all the potential in the world but has work to get to a good NFL starter.
QB Kyle McCord Syracuse 76
size: 6'3 224, 31 1/4 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 34 TD 12 INT 4,760 yards 65.8%, 89.9 PASS 77.4 RUN 36 BTT 22 TWP
info: 22 years old. 4-star recruit, out of St. Joseph's Prep in PA, where he was named Pennsylvania Gatorade Player of the Year. At Ohio State, he played in 24 games, starting 13, and threw for 3,776 yards and 27 touchdowns. Transferred to Syracuse in 2024, setting single-season school records with 4,779 passing yards and 34 touchdowns, leading the FBS in passing yards and earning Holiday Bowl MVP honors.
pros: Good accuracy, puts the ball where he wants it. Catchable ball, nice spin and good touch. Solid pocket mobility, doesn’t get sacked much. Delivers the ball when getting hit. Pushes the ball down the field well. Solid zip on his passes. Can go through progression and work the ball to a check down.
cons: Had a loaded OSU team in 2023 and wasn’t dominant. Poor decision maker, lapses in judgment and forces to ball to his first read. Doesn’t scramble, needs to pick up easy yards with his legs. Wouldn’t be classified as a playmaker.
take: McCord would be classified as a good game manager, he’s not the QB to come in and take over games. The issue is he makes a lot of weird decisions where he can’t come off his first read and puts the ball in harms way. He’s a talented QB with solid size and a NFL arm, but he doesn’t lift a team like top picks do.
TE Oronde Gadsden Syracuse 76
size: 6’4 247, 33 5/8 arms, 9 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 73 receptions 934 yards 7 TDs, 82.3 RECV 5.2% drop 60.7% contested
info: 22 years old. 4-star recruit from Bergen Catholic High School in Oradell, New Jersey, where he was a highly regarded wide receiver. Gadsden initially committed to the University of Miami but later transferred to Syracuse in 2022. At Syracuse, he made an immediate impact, leading the team in receiving yards and touchdowns. In 2023, Gadsden recorded 71 receptions for 1,041 yards and 9 touchdowns, establishing himself as one of the top wide receivers in the ACC. He was named to the First-Team All-ACC following his breakout season.
pros: Great production in 2022 with a bad QB. Can find space between zones. Great receiving threat as a TE, can play X. Makes good adjustments to the ball when it’s in the air. Solid at stalk blocking in space. Good at winning in man 1v1. Good size.
cons: Not a strong TE that you can rely on blocking. Tweener, more of a big slot. Foot injury hurt progression for a year in 2023. Not great at making guys miss.
take: Gadsden is a unique player, he’s listed at TE but plays big slot as well as X and Wing. He’s a great receiver for a TE with good athleticism and great ball skills but he’s not thick enough to play actual TE. He will either need to add a lot more mass or be a back of the roster situational TE.

pros: Very good hands, low drop percentage. Decent true freshman season in the SEC. Crisp out of breaks. Great catch radius. Makes guys miss with the ball in his hands.

info: 23 years old. 4 star recruit out of Indian River in Portsmouth VA. He played 2 seasons at Florida before transferring to Virginia Tech.
pros: 3 straight years of plus pass rushing. Great get off, very quick. Productive pass rusher. Explosive edge rusher with good burst. Good hands while pass rushing. Good stunting edge pass rusher. Plays good technique in the run game.
cons: Not a long edge rusher. Couldn’t get on the field much at Florida early in his career. Wont be a stout run defender because of his size.
take: Powell-Ryland is an excellent college edge rusher that can play in the NFL. He has the technique to rush the passer and play the run at the next level. He just doesn’t have the prototypical size of an edge rusher that goes early.

info: 5 star recruit out of Stoughton Wisconsin.
pros: 4 year starter, over 3000 career snaps. High pedigree recruit. Wisconsin OL. Solid pass sets, good positioning. Good hands, refits and strikes well.
cons: Not an overly physical OL. Doesn’t move DL in the run game. Feet aren’t that quick. Slow to recover from being beat.
take: Nelson didn’t truly live up to the 5 star hype he had out of HS, he’s not athletically gifted enough to be a highly sought after OT. He’s played 4 very good seasons for the badgers and can play in the NFL.

take: James is a slightly tuned down Jamyr Gibbs. He will struggle with being a work horse but as a change of pace back he is electric.

size: *6'4 300, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,643 career snaps 10 pressures, 89.9 RBLK 87.3 PBLK
info: 0 star recruit out of Churchland in Portsmouth VA.
pros: Dominated his final year. Solid athlete, moves well for his size.
cons: Low level of competition. Wide hands, holds too much. No technique, he’s a project. Not the biggest OL.
take: NA
QB Tyler Shough Louisville 74
size: 6'5 231, 31 3/8 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 23 TD 6 INT 3,191 yards 62.1%, 88.6 PASS 56 RUN 22 BTT 8 TWP
info: 25 years old. 4-star recruit out of Hamilton High School in Chandler, Arizona. Shough began his collegiate career at Oregon, where he played from 2018 to 2020. He transferred to Texas Tech, playing from 2021 to 2023, and then to Louisville in 2024. In 2024, Shough threw for 3,195 yards, 23 touchdowns, and 6 interceptions, leading Louisville to an 11-3 record and a berth in the Sun Bowl.
pros: Experienced QB, 7 years of football and 3 programs. His only year of starting every game was very productive. Good size. Solid mobility. Throws with good touch.
cons: 7 years of college football and only made it through 1 full season with no injuries. Had trouble keeping the starting job early in his career. Doesn’t embrace contact in the pocket. Throw power is not impressive. Not agile at all, pocket movements and cuts in space are not quick.
take: Shough is a lot like Tanner Mckee in play style and background. Both have good size, recruiting profiles and physical abilities but injuries and lack of production drop down his stock. Shough seems like he can be a top tier backup.
RB Damien Martinez Miami 74
size: 6'0 241, 30 5/8 arms, 9 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 160 attempts 1,006 yards 10 TDs 1 Fum, 94.3 RUN 62.9 RECV 42 MFT
info: 21 years old. 3-star recruit from Lewisville High School in Lewisville, Texas, where he rushed for 4,341 yards and 66 touchdowns on 532 carries. At Oregon State, he played for two seasons (2022–2023), earning Pac-12 Offensive Freshman of the Year in 2022 and First-Team All-Pac-12 honors in both seasons. In 2024, he transferred to the University of Miami, rushing for 1,002 yards and 10 touchdowns on 145 carries (6.3 yards per carry), and catching 16 passes for 198 yards.
pros: Instant impact as a true freshman. Young back that never had a bad season. Always averaged above 6 YPC. Good size. Strong runner, tough to bring down. Solid out of the back field.
cons: Wasn’t a bell cow guy they leaned on. Not very quick. Isn’t an explosive athlete.
take: NA
RB DJ Giddens Kansas St 74
size: *6'1 212, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 206 attempts 1,343 yards 7 TDs 2 Fum, 84.4 RUN 33.6 RECV 54 MFT
info: 21 years old. Giddens was not a highly recruited back out of Junction City, Kansas, but he stayed close to home and committed to Kansas State. He sat his freshman year before becoming the primary backup to Deuce Vaughn in 2022. He broke out in 2023, starting for Kansas State and rushing for over 1,200 yards, earning 2nd-team All-Big 12 honors. In 2024, he rushed for 1,343 yards and 7 TDs, also adding 21 receptions for 258 yards and 1 TD.
pros: Earned his way to the field, was not a high recruit. Good ball security. Great short area shake, makes guys whiff in a phone booth. Great contact balance, tough to get down. Great vision. Great jump cuts. Runs feet through contact. Good receiving. Experienced in many run schemes.
cons: Runs a little high. Not a top tier athlete. Not much power behind his runs.
take: Giddens is one of the best backs in the NCAA. He has such good vision and feel for the position and does everything well. He is missing that top end athleticism, his speed and power are NFL average but the rest of his game is elite.
RB RJ Harvey UCF 74
size: 5'8 204, 29 3/4 arms, 8 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 231 attempts 1,578 yards 22 TDs 2 Fum, 89.9 RUN 62.7 RECV 70 MFT
info: 3-star recruit out of Edgewater in Orlando, FL, where he played three varsity football seasons as a dual-threat quarterback. He initially committed to Virginia before transferring to UCF after his redshirt freshman year, where he switched positions to running back. In 2022, he rushed for 796 yards and 5 TDs, adding 22 receptions for 215 yards. He broke out in 2023, rushing for 1,416 yards and 16 TDs, earning second-team All-AAC honors. In 2024, he rushed for 1,577 yards and 22 TDs, earning first-team All-Big 12 honors.
pros: Team captain. Back to back 1,400+ yard seasons. Good burst. Good open field speed. Solid size. Runs hard and through contact. Good short area quickness and shake.
cons: Older RB that didn’t break out until his 4th year. Not a good pass protector. Not a power back, wont be running through NFL LBs. Can get caught dancing in the backfield.
take: Harvey may not be the biggest RB but he has built a very impressive resume. He was very productive thanks to his good vision and very good quickness. He has experience being a work horse and may be able to continue that at the next level if given the opportunity.
RB Dylan Sampson Tennessee 74
size: *5'11 201, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 258 attempts 1,488 yards 22 TDs 4 Fum, 90.8 RUN 65.8 RECV 70 MFT
info: 20 years old. 4-star recruit out of Dutchtown High School in Geismar, Louisiana, where he was named the District 5-5A MVP. He committed to Tennessee over offers from Power 5 programs such as Baylor, Michigan State, and Ole Miss. Sampson made an immediate impact as a true freshman in 2022. He became a key contributor in 2023, rushing for 605 yards and 7 touchdowns. In 2024, he broke out with a stellar season, rushing for 1,488 yards and 22 touchdowns, earning All-SEC First Team honors.
pros: Elite final year, named SEC OPOY. Young RB, only 20 years old. Good speed. Good patience. Can slip through small openings in the defense.
cons: One year of being the starter. Fumbles too much. Tennessee has a very spread out non NFL type offense. Smaller RB. Not a physical runner that easily breaks tackles.
take: Sampson is a smaller back but he makes up for it with his athleticism. He doesn’t have the power to be a top tier RB but he has enough strength to be mixed in a RB rotation and a good 2.

pros: Elite speed. Top recruit that played for 2 major programs. Deep treat only. Can make guys miss in space.
cons: Never was a WR 1 on any team. Small receiver. Doesn’t have physicality to his game. Routes aren’t to the level they need to be.

After redshirting his first year due to illness, he played for USC in 2020, recording 21 receptions for 236 yards and two touchdowns. In 2022, McCoy transferred to the University of Tennessee, where he became a key player for the Volunteers. In his first season at Tennessee, he tallied 52 receptions for 667 yards and four touchdowns, contributing to the team's 11–2 record and victory in the Orange Bowl. In 2023, he suffered a season-ending ankle injury after accumulating 17 receptions for 217 yards and one touchdown over five games. Returning in 2024, McCoy led the Volunteers with 35 receptions, surpassing 100 career catches, and was recognized as a Jason Witten Collegiate Man of the Year semifinalist.
pros: High pedigree. Built to be an NFL player. Great speed on tape. Good subtle moves to separate. Can make plays with the ball. Good out of breaks. Good catch radius.
cons: Disappointing career production. Weird Tennessee offense. Old prospect that never dominated.

stat: 189 attempts 854 yards 12 TDs 2 Fum, 76.9 RUN 72.6 RECV 42 MFT
info: 21 years old. Gordon was a 3-star recruit out of Trinity in Euless, TX, where he averaged 10 yards per carry and rushed for over 2,500 yards in his senior year. He chose Oklahoma State, where he got a part-time role as a true freshman. In 2023, he broke out, rushing for 1,732 yards and 21 touchdowns, earning the Doak Walker Award. In 2024, he followed up with 854 yards and 12 touchdowns, earning 1st-team All-Big 12 honors.
pros: Lead NCAA in rushing in 2023. Dominated the big 12 as a 19 year old. Solid receiving production. Solid at breaking tackles, defenders slide off him. Good speed, can run away especially for size. Solid stiff arm. Good vision.
cons: Drop off in 2024. Taller back, center of gravity higher than you like. Not explosive with his cuts.
take: Gordon is a very productive back with good size and speed. He’s got the rare combination that will allow him to have a successful NFL career as a starting RB.

stat: 287 attempts 1,512 yards 17 TDs 2 Fum, 85.4 RUN 58.2 RECV 59 MFT
info: 23 years old. Brooks was a solid 3-star recruit with a lot of offers coming out of Manor, TX. He stayed close to home and chose Texas Tech, where he got playing time as a true freshman. Over the next 2 years, he led the team in rushing but didn’t produce like a top back. That all changed in 2023 when he broke out in a big way, rushing for over 1,500 yards. In 2024, Brooks earned 1st-team All-Big 12 honors, rushing for 1,269 yards and 16 touchdowns.
pros: Unbelievable 2023 season with 1500 yards and 96 MTF. Low center of gravity with good pad level. Great at forcing missed tackles. Runs hard. Good patience. Solid burt and agility on jump cuts.
cons: Took him 4 years to really break out. Not much of a speedster. Not much experience receiving out of the back field.
take: Brooks is a hard nosed physical runner that has the skills to be a starting NFL RB. He has the Javonte Williams I wont go down trait and he’s extremely hard to tackle.

info: 22 years old. 3-star recruit from Miami Palmetto Senior High School in Pinecrest, Florida. Played three seasons at the University of Miami (2021–2023) as a WR, appearing in 35 games with 69 receptions for 770 yards and 4 touchdowns, and 18 rushes for 177 yards and one touchdown. Transferred to SMU in 2024, transitioning to running back. In 10 games, he rushed 158 times for 1,026 yards (6.5 yards per carry) and 12 touchdowns, and caught 26 passes for 203 yards and two touchdowns. Totaled 1,470 yards from scrimmage and 14 touchdowns.
pros: Very good receiver for the position. Raw RB that produced well. Good jump cuts. Good moves in space to make a man miss.
cons: Only 1 year of RB production. Not good in pass pro. Not a decisive runner, vision may be a question. Not a power back.
take: NA

stat: 183 attempts 1,150 yards 15 TDs 4 Fum, 78.3 RUN 60.4 RECV 57 MFT
info: 23 years old. 3-star recruit out of Paulsboro, New Jersey, where he was a standout running back at Paulsboro High School. He committed to North Carolina A&T, where he played for two seasons before transferring to Virginia Tech. In 2023, he started all 13 games for the Hokies, rushing 173 times for 863 yards and 10 touchdowns. In 2024, he continued his strong performance, rushing 183 times for 1,158 yards and 15 touchdowns. He was named to the All-ACC Second Team as an all-purpose back in 2023 and to the Third Team as a running back in 2023. Additionally, he was recognized as a Sporting News and College Football Network All-American kick returner in 2023.
pros: Elite track runner, 7.03 60 meter. Makes defenders miss well. Runs very hard, feet churn through contact. Solid build, has good mass behind him. Great acceleration. Good patience and vision.
cons: Not a highly rated recruit with the early in career pedigree. 9 fumbles in 2023 and 2024, could have an issue. Doesn’t have great agility, more of a linear RB. Not a great receiver, hands are below average. Bad pass blocker, missed assignments and not physical blocking.
take: Tuten is a hard running strong and fast RB. He has the tools to be an NFL RB, but he lacks the 3rd down ability to be an every down back. He could start in the NFL but will probably find his way to a backup or committee role.
RB Trevor Etienne Georgia 73
size: 5'9 205, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 122 attempts 603 yards 9 TDs 2 Fum, 86.7 RUN 68.2 RECV 28 MFT
info: 21 years old. 4-star recruit, out of Jennings High School in LA, where he rushed for 2,455 yards and 34 touchdowns. At Florida, he played for two seasons, rushing for 1,472 yards and 14 touchdowns. He also contributed 30 receptions for 238 yards and 1 touchdown. Etienne was named to the SEC All-Freshman Team in 2022, rushing for 719 yards and 6 touchdowns. He transferred to Georgia in 2024, where he rushed for 609 yards and 9 touchdowns, helping lead the Bulldogs to a New Year's Six bowl game and earning Third Team All-SEC honors.
pros: Produced as an 18 year old true freshman. Really good vision and patience. Great acceleration. Solid at forcing missed tackles. Good power and quickness combo.
cons: DUI. Not the biggest back, can’t run through LBs. Long speed isn’t impressive. Never was a lead back.
take: Etienne didn’t get the speed of his brother and wont go as high in the draft. But you can tell he has the vision of a top NFL back and the acceleration to capitalize on the blocking. He may not be the most physically talented but he’s going to be a solid NFL RB.

info: 22 years old. 4 star prospect out of Muskego Wisconsin.
pros: Had an elite 2023 season with an 89 PFF grade. Played all over the defense, versatile safety. Good tackler, physical and sound. Good size.
cons: Drop off in play from 2023 to 2024. Coverage is only ok, not going to be great as a deep safety. Not a top tier athlete in space.
take: Wohler is a good in the box safety, he has the size and tackling ability to start in the NFL. He’s not a very good deep safety, his lack of movement skills will not allow him to be a top tier safety in coverage.

cons: 6 years of college with 1 elite year of production. Played a lot of slot but will be a true X in the NFL. Not a very fast downfield threat. Doesn’t add much with the ball in his hands.
take: Nash reminds me of Mike Evans with his ability to high point and the way he runs routes. He probably can’t emulate Evan’s physicality and speed which is why hes not a 1st round type guy. It’s concerning that it took him 6 years but he showed he can play at a high level in 2024.

info: Diggs was a very highly touted recruit out of Eastside in Camden NJ where he was named NJ Gatorade Player of the year. He committed to Texas A&M where he contributed as a redshirt freshman and then in 2022 became the starter and a team captain. He didn’t produce much more in his final year where he was also a team captain before deciding to transfer to play at the same school his brother committed to, Syracuse.
pros: Good at finishing plays. Solid size and length. Solid agility. Versatile, played the edge, DL and LB in coverage. Decent at keeping hands off him.
cons: No pass rush moves, just goes forward. Not the strongest edge setter. Get off is average. Stiff rusher, bend is bad.
take: Diggs is an NFL type edge player, with the size and athleticism to check off the boxes. He just lacks the juice that starting NFL edges have, he needs to play more aggressively with more refinement to have a NFL career.

pros: null
cons: Not an overly powerful back that runs through contact. Not a very aggressive runner. Doesn’t have special acceleration or burst.

He then transferred to the University of Arizona for the 2024 season, where he rushed for 106 yards and a touchdown in the season opener against New Mexico.

take: Gabriel is a very accomplished College QB that has always had success. He has the physical ability to play in the NFL,he’s just a little small. He’s a playmaker that is smart enough to run an offense, bit will never be a plus starter.

info: 22 years old. Wax was a star 2 way player at RB and LB in HS. He was a 3 star RB recruit out of Baltimore MD where he committed to Cuse over schools like Pitt and Temple.

pros: Good tackler, has a solid career Missed tackle rate. Solid QB spy, plays pursuit well. Solid at dipping under blockers. Solid at finding windows to attack in the run game. Solid instincts.
cons: Shorter linebacker without the length. Sub par NFL athlete. Lacking long speed. Doesn’t stack and shed very well. Gets eaten up when blockers get hands on him.
take: Wax was the leader of the Syracuse defense where he was a sure tackler and a good QB spy. He shows the ability to find windows and slip under blocks to make plays regularly. He’s not the rangiest LB, he’s on the shorter side and isn’t a fast LB which will limit his chances to play in the NFL.

stat: 29 TD 5 INT 3,042 yards 68.9%, 90.2 PASS 46.7 RUN 19 BTT 10 TWP
info: 24 years old. 2-star recruit out of Holy Trinity Catholic Secondary School in Oakville, Ontario, Canada.

pros: Played a full season on a torn ACL and led Indiana to a great season. Good size. Good touch throws and accuracy. 4 years of good starting experience. Flashes reading full field. Throws with anticipation.
cons: One year of Power 4 play. A lot of sacks senior year. College offense full of screens and RPOs. Has to get ACL surgery. Arm isn’t very strong. Too many fumbles.
take: Rourke may have gone high in the draft if he hadn’t torn his ACL before the year. He’s a smart and accurate QB with good size. His lack of mobility in his film from 2024 makes it hard to project him as a starter but once he heals he could get a shot.

pros: Great size for a power back. Has never fumbled. Former LB, can play special teams. Great power. Runs hard and picks up extra yards. Solid straight line speed.
cons: One year of production. Not a sudden back. Change of direction is not good. Vision is middle of the road.
take: Mullings is a one trick pony, he is a straight line power back. He hasn’t played much RB with only one year starting but if you need a situational short yardage back he can fill that role.

info: 24 years old. 4 star recruit out of Westfield in Chantilly VA. Played 3 seasons at North Carolina.
pros: Starting experience in the SEC. Dangerous blitzer, very physical and aggressive. Plus athlete. Team captain.
cons: Older player that took a while to get on the field. Tad undersized. Not much of an in the box run thumper, gets blocked easy. Nearly no ball production in the pass gave throughout his career. Just a little slow reacting.
take: Asante is a physical player that will hold up to NFL athleticism. He’s an older prospect that doesn’t react as quick as you would hope a very experienced LB would. He can be a good special teams player and fill in on defense.

cons: Lack of power, gets beat by power in the run game. Not an aggressive OL. Bad at getting off double teams.

QB Quinn Ewers Texas 69

stat: 31 TD 12 INT 3,469 yards 65.8%, 72 PASS 55.6 RUN 20 BTT 21 TWP
info: 22 years old. 5-star recruit, out of Southlake Carroll in TX, where he was named the Texas Gatorade Player of the Year. Began his college career at Ohio State in 2021 before transferring to Texas. At Texas, he started for 3 seasons, throwing for 9,106 yards and 67 touchdowns while leading the Longhorns to the College Football Playoff in 2023 and 2024, earning Second Team All-Big 12 honors.
pros: Top recruit. Very real arm talent, flicks the ball where he wants. Mobile enough to get outside the pocket. Throws with great touch.
cons: Bad attitude at the elite 11. Thinner frame. Plays with no sense of urgency. Don’t see many high level reads and progressions. Turnover issues.
take: Ewers is a talented passer that has high level arm talent. He is accurate and can push the ball down the field. He isn’t a high level QB as of right now though, he doesn’t read and anticipate the defense very well and is a little lackadaisical. He needs to dedicate to football and really hone in on his craft to be a starting NFL QB.

pros: Former top recruit. Great size. Good feet, throws with a nice base. Great job at not taking sacks. Mobile enough. Solid throwing on the run.
cons: Didn’t live up to his hype from HS. A little slow to make decisions. Missing the precision on his passes, slightly inaccurate. Arm isn’t impressive. Disappointing senior year.
take: Uiagalelei looks the part, he’s got great size and a solid arm with athleticism. He also plays the position pretty well, he has been coached well. But he’s a little underwhelming, he’s slow in everything he does whether that be diagnosing or getting the ball out. He can be a backup in the NFL, but it looks like that's it.

cons: Fumbles a little too often. Injured in the 2023 season and not much production. Acceleration is only average. Not a quick back, can’t plant the foot and go vertical.
take: Sanders is a big back that has a good track record of production. He’s not the best back because of his change of direction and acceleration but he can be a NFL teams power back.

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 26 receptions 270 yards 0 TDs, 58.9 RECV 7.1% drop 50% contested
info: 24 years old. Fleming was the number 1 WR recruit over JSN in 2020 out of PA where he was the Gatorade PoY. He committed along side JSN to play for the WR factory OSU. He had a hard time getting playing time over guys like Egbuka, JSN, MHJ, Olave, and Wilson. He had almost 1,000 yards in his OSU career before transferring to rival Penn State to finish his career.
pros: Top tier recruit that learned to play WR at Ohio St. Good size. Good straight line speed.
cons: Couldn’t get production at OSU with all the talent there. Slow out of breaks. Not a plus receiver with the ball.
take: Fleming had a disappoint career, he’s the rare top recruit that didn’t get into trouble and didn’t pan out. He’s got the size and speed to be an NFL receiver but thats really the only strengths. He’s not great with the ball in his hands and doesn’t move that well in his routes. He can be a bottom of the roster WR.
QB Tommy Mellott Montana St 67
size: *6'0 208, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 31 TD 2 INT 2,774 yards 67.1%, 90.7 PASS 93.7 RUN 26 BTT 7 TWP
info: info: 23 years old. 3-star recruit out of Butte High School in Butte, MT. Mellott began his collegiate career at Montana State, where he played from 2021 to 2024.

He also added 1,200 rushing yards and 15 rushing touchdowns. Mellott was named the 2024 Walter Payton Award winner, recognizing him as the top offensive player in FCS football.
pros: Walter Payton Award winner. Elite PFF grading at passing and running. Doesn’t throw many INTs. Plus runner. Good twitch in the pocket, quick at evading pressure.
cons: Only one year of full time starting. Low level of competition. Smaller QB Prospect. Too many fumbles. Passing game is only ok, not a pure pocket passer.
take: Mellott had a great year and he lead Montana State to a great season. He’s a good athlete that flashed in the passing game, but he’s not a great thrower of the football.
QB Payton Thorne Auburn 67
size: 6'1 210, 31 1/8 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 21 TD 9 INT 2,713 yards 62.4%, 76.7 PASS 58.7 RUN 12 BTT 7 TWP
info: 24 years old. 3-star recruit out of Arrowhead High School in Hartland, WI.

He transferred to Auburn for the 2024 season, where he earned the starting quarterback role. Thorne passed for 2,713 yards, 21 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions in his first season at Auburn.
pros: Team captain and a coach's son. Played consistently solid football over the course of 4 years. Very experienced QB. Smart player, keeps the ball out of harms way and works through progressions. Works in the pocket very well, protects the ball and avoids rushers.
cons: Didn’t improve much on stats or grades over the 4 years of starting. Doesn’t have plus arm strength. Accuracy is middle of the road. Average athlete, can’t be in the run game. Losing final season.
take: Thorne looks the part at QB, he clearly has been training his whole life to play the position. He’s smart, experienced, and has enough tools to be a plus college QB. Translating to the next level may be tough given he has no trump card physically. He would most likely be a career backup if he makes it in the league.
