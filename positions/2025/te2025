TE Oronde Gadsden Syracuse 76
size: 6’4 247, 33 5/8 arms, 9 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 73 receptions 934 yards 7 TDs, 82.3 RECV 5.2% drop 60.7% contested
info: 22 years old. 4-star recruit from Bergen Catholic High School in Oradell, New Jersey, where he was a highly regarded wide receiver. Gadsden initially committed to the University of Miami but later transferred to Syracuse in 2022. At Syracuse, he made an immediate impact, leading the team in receiving yards and touchdowns. In 2023, Gadsden recorded 71 receptions for 1,041 yards and 9 touchdowns, establishing himself as one of the top wide receivers in the ACC. He was named to the First-Team All-ACC following his breakout season.
pros: Great production in 2022 with a bad QB. Can find space between zones. Great receiving threat as a TE, can play X. Makes good adjustments to the ball when it’s in the air. Solid at stalk blocking in space. Good at winning in man 1v1. Good size.
cons: Not a strong TE that you can rely on blocking. Tweener, more of a big slot. Foot injury hurt progression for a year in 2023. Not great at making guys miss.
take: Gadsden is a unique player, he’s listed at TE but plays big slot as well as X and Wing. He’s a great receiver for a TE with good athleticism and great ball skills but he’s not thick enough to play actual TE. He will either need to add a lot more mass or be a back of the roster situational TE.
