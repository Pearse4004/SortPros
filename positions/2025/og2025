test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 career snaps 0 pressures, 0 RBLK 0 PBLK
info: 21 years old. Booker was a 4 star recruit out of IMG in FL where he was coached by a former NFL OL and was recruited by all the big schools. He chose Alabama and played both guard positions as a true freshman and was an All SEC Freshman selection. He broke out in 2023 starting every game and was an All SEC 1st team selection and a integral part of the Alabama OL.
pros: High recruit out of IMG. Great build, made in a lab. Has OT and OG versatility. Feet are always moving, carries his weight well. Good strength, solid anchoring. Good technique, solid hands and plays long. Handles stunts well.
cons: Can be lazy on reps. Needs to do a better job displacing DL in the run game. Could have a little more of a mean streak. Can get caught leaning. A little slow at tackle.
take: Booker is an extremely talented OL with great size and athleticism. He's got it all and can start in the NFL day 1. He still needs to work on some bad habits but he can be all pro if he wants.

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 career snaps 0 pressures, 0 RBLK 0 PBLK
info: *21 years old. 3 star recruit out of Hawaii. Chose Arizona to flip the program around and learn from the OL coach. Started as a true freshman earning PFF All 1st team freshman honors. Started every game as a Sophomore forming a top tier OT combo with Jordan Morgan.
pros: Played a little guard as well and dominated in pass pro. Moves very well, can get out and block in space. Powerful OL, has knock down power and can move doubles. Great size and carries it well. Great change of direction and agility. Good Anchor.
cons: Oversets from time to time. Not aggressive in the run game, plays a little slow. Technique and IQ need to develop.
take: Savaiinaea is a big strong athlete that can be an all pro type OL. He’s so athletic at his size he can play both OT and OG. He still needs to develop, learn OT sets better and be more aggressive in the run game. He has a chance to be an all pro type OL.
