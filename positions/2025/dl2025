test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 34 pressures 5 sacks 28 tackles, 92.4 RDEF 78 TACK 79.5 PRSH
info: 21 years old. 4 star recruit out of Servite in Anaheim CA. Rotational player as a true freshman where he was Michigans Co Freshman DPOY and PFF Freshman All American. He broke out in 2023 being named 2nd team All AMerican and 1st team All Big 10.
pros: Very powerful at the point of attack. Has a nice bull rush. Stack and sheds great. Very hard to block, uses hands well to get OL off him. Tosses OL, has superior strength. Can hold up to double teams. As good as it gets in the run game.
cons: Not an elite freaky athlete. Pass rush isn’t elite. Doesn’t have great length.
take: Graham is an elite DL, he’s a dominant run stopper and a good pass rusher. He has great block destruction where people can’t block him and he can hold up on double teams. He will be at worst a good starter.
