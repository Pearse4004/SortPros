pros: Great at the quarterback position, great mechanics. Decent athlete, can move a bit to extend plays. Great accuracy. Good decision maker and processor. Understands matchups and gives his guys chances.
cons: Takes too many sacks. Arm strength is nothing special. Not much of a playmaker, doesn’t make stuff happen by himself. Trys to be a hero to often with his legs.
take: Sanders is a modern day prototypical QB, He’s got the needed athleticism but he really excels in the pocket. He makes good decisions and has a great ability to place the ball where he wants it. He’s not the top tier playmaker 1st overall picks are but he is a very good QB.
QB Jaxson Dart Ole Miss 76
size: 6'2 225, 30 3/8 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

pros: Has arm talent, solid strength and accuracy. Solid athleticism, moves well. Throws well off platform. Can run the ball effectively. Improved 4 straight years. Started 4 years in the SEC and PAC 12. High Big time throw percentage.
cons: Heel clicky, base needs to be better. Lack of anticipation, doesn’t throw before the break. Inconsistent accuracy because of feet. Likes to hit the primary target mostly. Unsure of his decision making for the NFL level.
take: Dart is a talented QB that has everything you need in an NFL QB physically. He’s built well and has nice athleticism to him with a solid arm, but mentally he doesn’t have the best tape. He likes to lock on his number one and his feet need reworking.
QB Jalen Milroe Alabama 76

pros: Top tier running for a QB, great athlete. Willing to take shots in the pocket. Nice powerful quick release. Solid anticipation. Flashes of great deep balls.
cons: Inconsistent accuracy. Not a high level reading the field and decision making. Fumbling issues.
take: Milroe is an elite athlete with a solid arm to go along with it. He’s lacking the accuracy and isn’t currently a high level processor at the QB position. He’s got all the potential in the world but has work to get to a good NFL starter.
QB Cam Ward Miami 75
size: *6'1 223, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

pros: Well-built frame, good amount of mass on him. Can throw off platform and from different angles. Good athlete, can scramble and extend plays as well as run the ball. Nice quick release. Throws with good anticipation. Very experienced QB. Makes plays happen out of structure.
cons: On the shorter side of quarterbacks. Only one year where he really stood out. Lazy on reps. Fumbling issues. Arm isn’t at a plus NFL level.
take: Ward had a great final year of college where he lead Miami to their best season in a long time. He has some good physical tools to go with with 5 years of starting experience. He’s not the perfect prospect but should get a shot to start in the NFL and can easily be a good backup.
QB Kyle McCord Syracuse 75
size: 6'3 224, 31 1/4 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 34 TD 12 INT 4,760 yards 65.8%, 89.9 PASS 77.4 RUN 36 BTT 22 TWP

pros: Good accuracy, puts the ball where he wants it. Catchable ball, nice spin and good touch. Solid pocket mobility, doesn’t get sacked much. Delivers the ball when getting hit. Pushes the ball down the field well. Solid zip on his passes. Can go through progression and work the ball to a check down.
cons: Had a loaded OSU team in 2023 and wasn’t dominant. Poor decision maker, lapses in judgment and forces to ball to his first read. Doesn’t scramble, needs to pick up easy yards with his legs. Wouldn’t be classified as a playmaker.
take: McCord would be classified as a good game manager, he’s not the QB to come in and take over games. The issue is he makes a lot of weird decisions where he can’t come off his first read and puts the ball in harms way. He’s a talented QB with solid size and a NFL arm, but he doesn’t lift a team like top picks do.
QB Tyler Shough Louisville 73
size: 6'5 231, 31 3/8 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

pros: Experienced QB, 7 years of football and 3 programs. His only year of starting every game was very productive. Good size. Solid mobility. Throws with good touch.
cons: 7 years of college football and only made it through 1 full season with no injuries. Had trouble keeping the starting job early in his career. Doesn’t embrace contact in the pocket. Throw power is not impressive. Not agile at all, pocket movements and cuts in space are not quick.
take: Shough is a lot like Tanner Mckee in play style and background. Both have good size, recruiting profiles and physical abilities but injuries and lack of production drop down his stock. Shough seems like he can be a top tier backup.
QB Riley Leonard Notre Dame 72
size: 6'3 221, 32 1/4 arms, 9 1/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

size: *6'5 223, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

pros: Played a full season on a torn ACL and led Indiana to a great season. Good size. Good touch throws and accuracy. 4 years of good starting experience. Flashes reading full field. Throws with anticipation.
cons: One year of Power 4 play. A lot of sacks senior year. College offense full of screens and RPOs. Has to get ACL surgery. Arm isn’t very strong. Too many fumbles.
take: Rourke may have gone high in the draft if he hadn’t torn his ACL before the year. He’s a smart and accurate QB with good size. His lack of mobility in his film from 2024 makes it hard to project him as a starter but once he heals he could get a shot.
QB Quinn Ewers Texas 69
size: *6'2 195, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

cons: Bad attitude at the elite 11. Thinner frame. Plays with no sense of urgency. Don’t see many high level reads and progressions. Turnover issues.
take: Ewers is a talented passer that has high level arm talent. He is accurate and can push the ball down the field. He isn’t a high level QB as of right now though, he doesn’t read and anticipate the defense very well and is a little lackadaisical. He needs to dedicate to football and really hone in on his craft to be a starting NFL QB.

take: Uiagalelei looks the part, he’s got great size and a solid arm with athleticism. He also plays the position pretty well, he has been coached well. But he’s a little underwhelming, he’s slow in everything he does whether that be diagnosing or getting the ball out. He can be a backup in the NFL, but it looks like that's it.

take: Jefferson is a big strong QB that has had a lot of success at Arkansas. He’s lacking the arm talent to get him drafted early but he has the body type and athletic ability to play in the NFL.

pros: Team captain and a coach's son. Played consistently solid football over the course of 4 years. Very experienced QB. Smart player, keeps the ball out of harms way and works through progressions. Works in the pocket very well, protects the ball and avoids rushers.
cons: Didn’t improve much on stats or grades over the 4 years of starting. Doesn’t have plus arm strength. Accuracy is middle of the road. Average athlete, can’t be in the run game. Losing final season.
take: Thorne looks the part at QB, he clearly has been training his whole life to play the position. He’s smart, experienced, and has enough tools to be a plus college QB. Translating to the next level may be tough given he has no trump card physically. He would most likely be a career backup if he makes it in the league.
