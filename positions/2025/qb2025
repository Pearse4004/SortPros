pros: Great at the quarterback position, great mechanics. Decent athlete, can move a bit to extend plays. Great accuracy. Good decision maker and processor. Understands matchups and gives his guys chances.
cons: Takes too many sacks. Arm strength is nothing special. Not much of a playmaker, doesn’t make stuff happen by himself. Trys to be a hero to often with his legs.
take: Sanders is a modern day prototypical QB, He’s got the needed athleticism but he really excels in the pocket. He makes good decisions and has a great ability to place the ball where he wants it. He’s not the top tier playmaker 1st overall picks are but he is a very good QB.

take: Ward had a great final year of college where he lead Miami to their best season in a long time. He has some good physical tools to go with with 5 years of starting experience. He’s not the perfect prospect but should get a shot to start in the NFL and can easily be a good backup.

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

cons: Heel clicky, base needs to be better. Lack of anticipation, doesn’t throw before the break. Inconsistent accuracy because of feet. Likes to hit the primary target mostly. Unsure of his decision making for the NFL level.
take: Dart is a talented QB that has everything you need in an NFL QB physically. He’s built well and has nice athleticism to him with a solid arm, but mentally he doesn’t have the best tape. He likes to lock on his number one and his feet need reworking.

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

cons: Inconsistent accuracy. Not a high level reading the field and decision making. Fumbling issues.
take: Milroe is an elite athlete with a solid arm to go along with it. He’s lacking the accuracy and isn’t currently a high level processor at the QB position. He’s got all the potential in the world but has work to get to a good NFL starter.
QB Kurtis Rourke Indiana 73
size: *6'5 223, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

cons: One year of Power 4 play. A lot of sacks senior year. College offense full of screens and RPOs. Has to get ACL surgery. Arm isn’t very strong. Too many fumbles.
take: Rourke may have gone high in the draft if he hadn’t torn his ACL before the year. He’s a smart and accurate QB with good size. His lack of mobility in his film from 2024 makes it hard to project him as a starter but once he heals he could get a shot.
QB Carson Beck Georgia 72
size: *6'4 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

cons: Too many fumbles. Not an overpowering arm, just average. Doesn’t make many plays happen on his own. Not a plus runner. Drop off in play from 23-24.
take: Beck is a very good quarterback that can run an offense at a NFL level. He’s smart, accurate, and refined with solid size and arm strength. He can’t take an offense to a higher level, he’s not a playmaker which will limit his draft ceiling.
QB Tyler Shough Louisville 71
size: *6'5 225, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: 25 years old. 4 star recruit out of Hamilton in Chandler AZ. He has played for 3 programs, including Oregon, Texas Tech, and Lousiville.
pros: Experienced QB, 7 years of football and 3 programs. His only year of starting every game was very productive. Good size. Solid mobility. Throws with good touch.
cons: 7 years of college football and only made it through 1 full season with no injuries. Had trouble keeping the starting job early in his career. Doesn’t embrace contact in the pocket. Throw power is not impressive. Not agile at all, pocket movements and cuts in space are not quick.
take: Shough is a lot like Tanner Mckee in play style and background. Both have good size, recruiting profiles and physical abilities but injuries and lack of production drop down his stock. Shough seems like he can be a top tier backup.
QB Mark Gronowski South Dakota 71
size: *6'3 225, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

cons: Low level of competition in the FCS. Low completion percentage his senior year. Struggles with accuracy on touch throws.
take: Gronowski is an impressive QB with his size and ability. He’s built like an RB but has 4 years of good QB tape. He’s still raw, his accuracy and level of play are a concern but he’s an NFL caliber QB.
QB Dillon Gabriel Oregon 70
size: *5'11 205, NA arms, NA hands.

take: Gabriel is a very accomplished College QB that has always had success. He has the physical ability to play in the NFL,he’s just a little small. He’s a playmaker that is smart enough to run an offense, bit will never be a plus starter.
QB DJ Uiagalelei Florida St 69
size: *6'4 243, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

pros: Former top recruit. Great size. Good feet, throws with a nice base. Great job at not taking sacks. Mobile enough. Solid throwing on the run.
cons: Didn’t live up to his hype from HS. A little slow to make decisions. Missing the precision on his passes, slightly inaccurate. Arm isn’t impressive. Disappointing senior year.
take: Uiagalelei looks the part, he’s got great size and a solid arm with athleticism. He also plays the position pretty well, he has been coached well. But he’s a little underwhelming, he’s slow in everything he does whether that be diagnosing or getting the ball out. He can be a backup in the NFL, but it looks like that's it.

take: Brosmer is a full blown game manager. He isn't much of an athlete and doesn't make many big throws but he's smart with the ball and operates the offense.
QB KJ Jefferson UCF 68
size: *6’3 243, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 19 TD 8 INT 2,107 yards 64%, 70.4 PASS 75.7 RUN 16 BTT 15 TWP

He followed that up with another 2,300 yard season and 22 TDs.
pros: Big strong QB, has great size and strength to play QB. Throws from a solid base, good feet. Good athlete, can be a designed run game QB.
cons: Long time to throw and takes a high percentage of sacks. Eyes down and run when any pressure arrives, needs to keep his eyes up. Not accurate, misses throws constantly. Doesn’t see the field well, locks in to one receiver. Slow release, takes a bit to set feet and let it go.
take: Jefferson is a big strong QB that has had a lot of success at Arkansas. He’s lacking the arm talent to get him drafted early but he has the body type and athletic ability to play in the NFL.
QB Payton Thorne Auburn 67
size: *6'2 203, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

cons: Didn’t improve much on stats or grades over the 4 years of starting. Doesn’t have plus arm strength. Accuracy is middle of the road. Average athlete, can’t be in the run game. Losing final season.
take: Thorne looks the part at QB, he clearly has been training his whole life to play the position. He’s smart, experienced, and has enough tools to be a plus college QB. Translating to the next level may be tough given he has no trump card physically. He would most likely be a career backup if he makes it in the league.
