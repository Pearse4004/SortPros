stat: 73 tackles 1 INT 5 PBU, 70.1 RDEF 75.4 TACK 71.2 COV
info: 3 star recruit out of Covenant in Charlottesville VA.
pros: 2 time All ACC 1st team. Good positioning in zone coverage. Good burst to close distance quickly. Can cover in man. Good open field tackler. Good size. Team captain.
cons: Can get fooled by backfield action and being over aggressive. Wasn’t a day 1 starter.
take: Sanker is a very good safety prospect. He’s got good size, athleticism, and has played at a high level for the last 2 years. He can play in the NFL right now and be a starter.

stat: 61 tackles 0 INT 6 PBU, 74 RDEF 73.7 TACK 66.7 COV
info: 22 years old. 4 star prospect out of Muskego Wisconsin.
pros: Had an elite 2023 season with an 89 PFF grade. Played all over the defense, versatile safety. Good tackler, physical and sound. Good size.
cons: Drop off in play from 2023 to 2024. Coverage is only ok, not going to be great as a deep safety. Not a top tier athlete in space.
take: Wohler is a good in the box safety, he has the size and tackling ability to start in the NFL. He’s not a very good deep safety, his lack of movement skills will not allow him to be a top tier safety in coverage.

stat: 52 tackles 2 INT 3 PBU, 68.6 RDEF 78.1 TACK 76.6 COV
info: 4 star recruit out of Lufkin TX. Committed to Texas and played 4 seasons there, 3 as a starter. Transferred to Auburn and became a team captain.
pros: Team captain. Experienced defensive back against top tier competition. Smart and instinctive player. Stays in good position and doesn’t get beat often. Versatile, played all over the field.
cons: Not the biggest safety, may struggle with physicality in the NFL.
take: Thompson is a good football player that can do a little of everything. He’s a team captain, played all over the field and started for 4 seasons. He’s not physically imposing which will limit him but he should end up playing in the NFL.

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 tackles 0 INT 0 PBU, 0 RDEF 0 TACK 0 COV
info: 22 years old. Clark was a 4 star recruit out of Camden NJ who played along side fellow Cuse teammate Duce Chestnut. He stayed close to home and committed to Rutgers where he didn’t see much playing time. He transferred to Cuse in 2022 to play with Duce and started every year he was at Cuse.
pros: Comes downhill fast, wants to get in the action. Good in man, can lock down TE’s and slots. Good change of direction. Solid speed.
cons: On the skinnier side, needs to add some mass at safety. Not a very sound tackler. Follows the QBs eyes a lot and doesn’t see routes develop.
take: Clark is a very good athlete with good coverage skills. He can man up in the slot and play well in zone, but he’s not a true safety. He is a below average tackler at a skinnier frame which won't hold up in the league.
