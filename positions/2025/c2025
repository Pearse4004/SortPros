stat: 0 career snaps 0 pressures, 0 RBLK 0 PBLK
info: *23 years old. 3 star recruit out of Moorpark CA. Redshirt 2020. Started 7 games at RT in 2021. Became a full time starter playing at both RG and RT in 2022. Switched to the left side in 2023 gaining All Pac 12 2nd team honors. Came back in 2024 to play center and serve as a team captain.
pros: Played LT, RT, RG, and C. Works hard in the run game. Experienced OL. Good movement skills. Good feet in pass pro.
cons: Not physically built to play tackle, more interior. Not great at stopping bull rush. Gets bullied by LBs.
take: Monheim is an experienced OL that has played well against power 5 competition. He’s not big or long but he is a solid athlete. He is very sound in pass pro and can play all 5 positions.

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 career snaps 0 pressures, 0 RBLK 0 PBLK
info: Mclaughlin was a 3 star recruit out of Buford GA where he helped his team win a state championship. He committed to Bama to play for Saban but got nearly no time as a true freshman. He was the back up center for Bama until midway through 2022 when he grabbed ahold of the job. He anchored the Tides OL in 2023 before transferring to Ohio State for his final year.
pros: Plays with good leverage. Great snaps. Works hard in his blocks, doesn’t give up. Good hands and technique.
cons: Not a very big center. Not the most physically gifted player. Gets off balance too often, too much effort at times.
take: Mclaughlin is a solid center who gets the job done. He snaps very well and works hard to hold his blocks. He’s not physically gifted so his ceiling is low but his floor is NFL backup.

take: Majors is an NFL average center, he’s smart, physical, and experienced. He has a lot of snaps at a big time level and has blocked well. He’s not overpowering or really adding to the run game but he could start in the NFL.
