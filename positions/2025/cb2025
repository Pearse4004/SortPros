CB Will Johnson Michigan 88
size: *6'2 202, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 20 tackles 4 INT 2 PBU 17/37 267 yards, 69 TACK 78.5 COV
info: 22 years old. 4 star recruit out of Grosse Pointe MI. He committed to Michigan and immediately got on the field as a true freshman and was named a Freshman All American. He followed that up with an All American Sophomore season and a National championship to go with it. He had an injury filled junior season but still put up impressive numbers.
pros: Came in as a true freshman and played great. Accomplished CB, he’s a national champion and All American. Very good athlete. Quick to break on routes. Good ball production over his career. Great in zone and seeing the field. Good size, can match up with bigger WRs.
cons: Not overly physical. Can be grabby. Can get beat at the catch point.
take: Johnson is a top tier CB that has great technique and athleticism. He will walk in day 1 and be a CB1 for a team.
