WR Luther Burden Missouri 82
size: *5'11 208, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 61 receptions 676 yards 6 TDs, 80.7 RECV 4.7% drop 50% contested
info: 21 years old. Burden was the guy at East St Louis HS, he was the max preps player of the year and a consensus 5 star recruit. He committed to Missouri where he immediately started 10 games. His real breakout happened in 2023 where he had over 1,200 receiving yards and was named All SEC and 2nd team all american. He had a drop off in production in his final season though.
pros: Great with the ball in his hands, becomes a RB. Great acceleration after the catch. Great deceleration out of top speed. Flashes nice moves to get hands off him down the field. Good speed, can get vertical. Solid at catching through contact. Good hands.
cons: Played most of his snaps in the slot. Not good at dealing with physicality at the line of scrimmage. Not much nuance to his routes.
take: Burden is electric with the ball in his hands, he’s a threat to score every time he gets it. He’s very fast and has good physicality to break tackles. He’s not the most refined WR, but he has the natural hands and athleticism to get there.
WR Travis Hunter Colorado 97
size: *6'1 185, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 92 receptions 1,152 yards 14 TDs, 88.3 RECV 3.2% drop 68.8% contested
info: 23 years old. Hunter was the top dog coming out of Collins Hill in GA where he was the number 1 HS recruit in 2022. Surprisingly he followed Deion Sanders to Jackson State over all power 5 teams. He dominated there mostly at CB before following Sanders again to Colorado to build that program. He became a 2 way player showing that he is a great WR and Corner.
pros: Former number 1 recruit, very talented. 2 way player both at a high level. Elite with the ball in his hands making people miss. Great speed. Great acceleration. Very reliable hands. Elite quickness and agility. Great ball skills. Feet are quick.
cons: Because he’s playing both ways some reps off. Not a very refined WR, still has work to do. Thin frame, should add some mass, unsure of handling physicality.
take: Hunter is one of the most talented players ever in college football. He’s dominate at 2 positions because he’s an elite athlete. He has the rare ball skills to go along with his athleticism as well making him a potential hall of fame player.
WR Nick Nash San Jose St 74
size: *6'3 195, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 104 receptions 1,382 yards 16 TDs, 86.1 RECV 6.3% drop 50% contested
info: NA
pros: Huge final year, won the triple crown. Very good at catching the ball outside his frame. Can climb up the ladder to catch the ball. Solid routes, good ability to break down at his size.
cons: 6 years of college with 1 elite year of production. Played a lot of slot but will be a true X in the NFL. Not a very fast downfield threat. Doesn’t add much with the ball in his hands.
take: Nash reminds me of Mike Evans with his ability to high point and the way he runs routes. He probably can’t emulate Evan’s physicality and speed which is why hes not a 1st round type guy. It’s concerning that it took him 6 years but he showed he can play at a high level in 2024.
