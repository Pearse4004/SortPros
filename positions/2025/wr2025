stat: 92 receptions 1,152 yards 14 TDs, 88.3 RECV 3.2% drop 68.8% contested
info: 23 years old. Hunter was the top dog coming out of Collins Hill in GA where he was the number 1 HS recruit in 2022. Surprisingly he followed Deion Sanders to Jackson State over all power 5 teams. He dominated there mostly at CB before following Sanders again to Colorado to build that program. He became a 2 way player showing that he is a great WR and Corner.
pros: Former number 1 recruit, very talented. 2 way player both at a high level. Elite with the ball in his hands making people miss. Great speed. Great acceleration. Very reliable hands. Elite quickness and agility. Great ball skills. Feet are quick.
cons: Because he’s playing both ways some reps off. Not a very refined WR, still has work to do. Thin frame, should add some mass, unsure of handling physicality.
take: Hunter is one of the most talented players ever in college football. He’s dominate at 2 positions because he’s an elite athlete. He has the rare ball skills to go along with his athleticism as well making him a potential hall of fame player.
WR Tetairoa McMillan Arizona 91
size: *6'5 212, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 84 receptions 1,316 yards 8 TDs, 85.8 RECV 7.7% drop 60% contested
info: 22 years old. 5-star recruit, out of Servite High School in Anaheim, California, where he recorded 88 receptions for 1,302 yards and 18 touchdowns as a senior. At Arizona, he set the school's all-time receiving yards record with 3,423 yards. In 2024, he made 84 receptions for 1,319 yards and 8 touchdowns, earning First-Team All-Big 12 honors and being named the Polynesian College Football Player of the Year.
pros: Great size, very tall and long WR. Great hands, natural hand catcher. Amazing feel for attacking open spots in zone. Smooth mover, glides through his routes. Good immediately after the catch. Huge catch radius. Can make spectacular catches.
cons: Not the quickest twitch WR. Not a separator against man.
take: McMillan is your prototypical big X receiver that has great hands. He is very good at finding the soft spots in zone and athletic enough to take advantage of it. He’s a talented WR that can be a WR1 in the NFL.
WR Emeka Egbuka Ohio St 86
size: *6'1 206, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 81 receptions 1,011 yards 10 TDs, 82.4 RECV 5.8% drop 59.1% contested
info: 22 years old. Egbuka was a 5 star receiver out of Steilacoom WA where he was the Gatorade Player of the year and the number 1 receiver recruit in the country. He joined a loaded WR room with Olave, Wilson, JSN, and MHJ so he had to wait a year to break out. That he did, in 2022 he had over 1,100 receiving yards and 74 receptions. He came back in 2023 and delt with injuries and worse QB play which drastically reduced his production.
pros: Top level recruit at OSU that was good as a true sophomore. Good size. Great acceleration off the line. Good hands, catches away from his body. Good at the top of routes, uses hands and sells routes well. Great at attacking leverage of defenders to set up breaks. Solid with the ball in his hands, gets upfield and can run through bad tackles.
cons: Doesn’t have the elite agility and quickness at the top of breaks. Unsure about his feel vs zone and finding space. Not a very good deep threat.
take: Egbuka is a polished Ohio State WR with good routes, hands, and solid athleticism. He has all the tools and ability to immediately be a starting NFL WR. The only draw back is that he’s not the elite athlete with the upside of a top 10 NFL WR.

info: 23 years old. 2-star recruit out of Comeaux in Lafayette LA. Not much production as a true freshman. Became the teams number 1 WR in 2021 and took over in 2022 and was named 1st team All Conference. He was a 4 star transfer to Ole miss after his breakout junior season and immediately took over the Ole Miss WR room.
pros: Good size. Good career production. Very reliable hands. Great at catching away from his frame. Handles press very well, good releases. Great strength catching through contact. Good routes, sets up breaks. Body control is great, makes plays in the air. Makes DBs miss in space. Good long speed
cons: Ole Miss offense, different than the NFL. Not an elite athlete, not twitched up. Not the high pedigree out of HS that produced immediately.
take: Harris is an NFL ready X receiver right now. He’s physically built to play on the outside in the NFL and his play style aligns with that. He is elite in contested catch situations and has elite hands. He can make guys wimm with the ball and separate which will allow him to be a WR 1.

pros: Great with the ball in his hands, becomes a RB. Great acceleration after the catch. Great deceleration out of top speed. Flashes nice moves to get hands off him down the field. Good speed, can get vertical. Solid at catching through contact. Good hands.
cons: Played most of his snaps in the slot. Not good at dealing with physicality at the line of scrimmage. Not much nuance to his routes.
take: Burden is electric with the ball in his hands, he’s a threat to score every time he gets it. He’s very fast and has good physicality to break tackles. He’s not the most refined WR, but he has the natural hands and athleticism to get there.
