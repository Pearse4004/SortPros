OT Joe Alt Notre Dame 89
size: *6'7 317, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,214 career snaps 5 pressures, 86.9 RBLK 92.2 PBLK
info: Alt was a 4 star recruit out of Totino Grace in Minneapolis where he received offers from a few big 10 teams but ultimately went with the OL factory ND. He has the bloodlines to play professional ball, his dad John Alt is in the Chiefs HoF who was a pro bowl OL from Iowa. His freshman year he played some TE and by halfway through the season he took over the starting LT spot and played well. 2022 was his breakout year, he was an all American dominating in both the pass and run game only allowing 5 pressures all year.
pros: Good strong stance, good flexibility. Very smart player, picks up stunts instantly. Very good hand usage, strikes in the right spot and refits well. Great athlete, can pull well and get into space. Good mirroring ability, will rarely lose to counters and inside moves. Great at getting to the second level and washing backers away
cons: Plays off balance way too much, lunges too often and doesn’t keep his weight back. Needs to work on independent hand usage, a lot of 2 hands to the chest. He’s not a mauler, not the strongest. Crosses his feet and gets narrow too much, needs to play with a better base.
take: Alt is a very talented tackle that has the tools to be an all pro tackle. He has great athleticism too his game, he can pull and move in space at a high level as well as mirror pass rushers. His technique is pretty good for a college tackle, he does a great job refitting his hands and has good placement on strikes. He just needs to continue to develop, whether that be his strength/pad level or independent hand usage. Once he puts it all together he will be a top tier tackle in the NFL.

stat: 1,349 career snaps 10 pressures, 70.5 RBLK 88.4 PBLK
info: 21 years old.
pros: Never had a bad year, especially in pass pro. Great build, size and length is prototypical. Good athlete, moves well in space. Strong punch, can shock defenders at impact. Drives his feet well, keeps them churning. Lower half is very thick, good base.
cons: Not a refined tackle, still has a lot of technique development to do. Doesn’t have independent hand usage. Feet get sloppy and crossed over at times. Too off balance too many times.
take: Fashanu looks the part in every sense of being an NFL tackle. He’s long, explosive and athletic which are all un coachable. He has to really work on his sets, feet and hand placement to reach his potential but if he does he is an All pro type talent.
OT Jordan Morgan Arizona 80

cons: Not the best second level blocker against line backers. Not a plus athlete in the NFL. Can get caught leaning at times. Has the length of a guard and the build of a tackle.
take: Barton is a very good and experienced lineman that has played well every year in college. He has some good power behind his game and good technique to go with it. He is lacking in athleticism and length which will kick him inside in the NFL, but he should be able to start in the NFL very soon and be solid.

cons: A little too tall where he loses leverage. Didn’t play the best competition every week at Marshall.
take: Driskell is a long tackle that has the movement skills to play in the NFL. He doesn’t have much power to his game so he will most likely be a backup swing tackle.
