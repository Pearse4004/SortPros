WR Marvin Harrison Ohio St 95
size: 6'3 209, 31 7/8 arms, 9 1/2 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 67 receptions 1,211 yards 14 TDs, 89.6 RECV 8.2% drop 43.3% Contested
info: 21 years old. Harrison has some top tier genetics, his father Marvin Harrison Sr was a hall of fame receiver that was one of the best to ever do it. Harrison was a 4 star recruit out of St Josephs Prep in Philly where he broke conference records for receiving. He committed to OSU over Syracuse for some reason where he sat behind Olave, Wilson and JSN as a true freshman before becoming the guy in 2022. He went for 1,263 yards and 14 TDs while being an All American and somehow snubbed for the Biletnikoff.
pros: Great size. Very good speed, can run away from defenders. Great speed off the ball, accelerates and eats space very well. Great hands, Natural catcher of the football. Ball skills are top tier, can extend away from his body to make spectacular plays. Great at setting up CBs to get them off balance. Great hands at the release, can get defenders off him easily. Press is nothing for him, great at getting off it. Great body control and can play through contact, makes for some spectacular catches.
cons: Not much of a YAC receiver, not much of a screen target receiver. Takes some routes off, you can tell when he’s not looking for the ball. Has more drops on tape than you would like. Couple reps in the Michigan game Will Johnson got the better of him.
take: Harrison is the best receiver prospect I’ve ever seen, he’s a different beast. If you don’t need a QB he should be the first player off the board in nearly every draft.
WR Malik Nabers LSU 92
size: 6'0 200, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - 4.35 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 42 | broad - 10'9 | bench - 15.
stat: 89 receptions 1,568 yards 14 TDs, 92.9 RECV 5.3% drop 45.5% contested
info: 21 years old.
pros: Great speed, 2nd gear can run past DB’s. Great athlete, moves at the top of routes effortlessly without having to gear down. 30 forced missed tackles in 2023, good with the ball in his hands. Deep ball tracking is elite, focused on the ball and always comes up with it.
cons: Ball skills aren’t at an elite level. A lot of deep balls, stops, crossers and jets, needs to show more variety. Doesn’t sell his routes, he doesn’t attack DBs leverages.
take: Nabers is one of the most athletic receivers in football. His deep speed, agility and play strength are all top tier and he is great at catching the deep ball. Minimum he is a great deep threat for a team and if he gets the chance he could show that he’s a WR1 in the league.
WR Rome Odunze Washington 90
size: 6'3 212, 32 1/4 arms, 9 1/4 hands.
test: 40 - 4.45 | 3 cone - 6.88 | shuttle - 4.03 | vert - 39 | broad - 10'4 | bench - NA.
stat: 92 receptions 1,640 yards 13 TDs, 89.1 RECV 3.2% drop 74.1% contested
info: 22 Years old.
pros: Has great size, 6’3 215 he’s the prototype. Great production, over 1,500 yards and 13 TDs in 2023. Catch numbers were great, only 3% drop rate and had 20 contested catches. Great concentration, can catch it with guys draped on his back. Sudden off the line, his releases are nice. Great ball tracking skills, has a knack for getting in good position. Good at the top of routes getting hands off him. Smooth mover, nice breaks on routes and can move well after the catch.
cons: Didn’t do too much his first 2 seasons at Washington. A few routes here and there where he’s not going to space or slipping. Speed isn’t top tier, not a scary deep threat with speed. Just ok with the ball in his hands.
take: Odunze is a stud, he has every tool you look for with no glaring weakness. He has fantastic ball skills and good movement skills as well as great production. The biggest thing that will hold him back is if a QB doesn’t trust him and give him the opportunities he needs to make those plays for him.
WR Adonai Mitchell Texas 86
size: 6'2 205, 32 3/8 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - 4.34 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 39 1/2 | broad - 11'4 | bench - NA.
stat: 55 receptions 845 yards 11 TDs, 74.1 RECV 1.8% drop 36.4% contested
info: 21 years old.
pros: One drop in the last 2 years, very good hands. Good size for an X jump ball receiver, has good length too. Works back to the ball well, attacks it. Explosive athlete, solid speed, acceleration and vertical. Real nice subtle moves in his routes to create separation.
cons: See reps on tape where he may not have the best demeanor. Not a huge threat when the ball is in his hands.
take: Mitchell is a very talented WR, he has good size and is an explosive athlete. To go along with his physical gifts he catches the ball well and does a lot of nice things with his routes to create separation. He may not ever be a WR1 because he’s not great with the ball in his hands but he certainly should be an NFL starter.
WR Brian Thomas LSU 85
size: 6'3 209, 32 3/4 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - 4.33 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 38 1/2 | broad - 10'6 | bench - 11.
stat: 68 receptions 1,177 yards 17 TDs, 75.1 RECV 6.8% drop 53.8% contested
info: 21 years old.
pros: Unreal TD production, 17 TDs in 13 games. Very good deep threat, has the ball tracking skills to make plays down the field. Can win end zone jump balls and runs nice fades in the redzone. Good speed, can win with speed down the field.
cons: A lot of lazy routes as a product of the offense and not getting the ball. Cuts aren’t that good, not a polished receiver. Not the featured receiver in the offense. Hands aren't the most natural.
take: Thomas is a big play threat, he wins with good speed and great ball tracking skills. He has good length to make plays on balls out side his frame. He probably will never be a true 1 but he can fit a role in an NFL receivers room right now.
WR Ladd McConkey Georgia 83
size: 6'0 187, 30 1/4 arms, 8 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.39 | 3 cone - 6.72 | shuttle - 3.97 | vert - 36 | broad - 10'4 | bench - 13.
stat: 30 receptions 483 yards 2 TDs, 81.3 RECV 6.3% drop 40% contested
info: 22 years old.
pros: 2 time national champion and was the best receiver on the team. Student of the game, really good route runner. Sneaky athletic, really talented with the ball in his hands.
cons: Took a step back after a good 2022 season, missed the first few games. Hands aren’t the greatest, a couple double catches.
take: Ladd is a great receiver, he has the athletic ability paired with the routes to be a problem in the NFL. Not only that but he is great after the catch which adds a lot to his game. The only issue is he’s not the over the top talent that gets picked in round 1.
WR Xavier Legette South Carolina 83
size: 6'1 223, 31 7/8 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - 4.39 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 40 | broad - 10'6 | bench - 24.
stat: 71 receptions 1,255 yards 7 TDs, 86.8 RECV 2.7% drop 47.6% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Really good size, solid frame with good height. Pretty good long speed, once he opens it up he can move. Pretty good run after catch, strong with the ball in his hands. Great at the catch point, has the ability to go up and win rebounds. Good hands, can make catches through contact and doesn’t drop many.
cons: One year production, played 4 seasons with under 500 yards total. Releases are slow, doesn’t get instantly off press. Not a separator, defenders have an easy time sticking to him. Not quick, doesn’t have the ability to change directions well.
take: Leggette is your typical jump ball big bodied receiver. He has impressive size speed and ball skills with the senior year production to go along with it. His separation ability will be questionable in the NFL especially with more physical DBs.
WR Xavier Worthy Texas 82
size: 5'11 165, 31 1/8 arms, 8 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - 4.21 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 41 | broad - 10'11 | bench - NA.
stat: 75 receptions 1,014 yards 5 TDs, 71.9 RECV 6.3% drop 23.8% contested
info: 21 Years Old. Elite track runner, ran a 10.55 100m. Big 12 freshman of the year.
pros: Can throw the ball 50 yards. 3 years of good production at Texas with a 900 yard freshman year. Really good speed, his 2nd gear can blow past DBs. Great athlete, smooth in every movement. Good quickness with the ball in his hands. Good return man.
cons: Overall small player. Some real soft plays where he can’t handle physicality. Catching the ball through contact is not his game. At his size and athleticism level, he needs to run more polished routes.
take: Worthy is a great athlete that is a little undersized. That isn’t as much of a problem as it used to be with the rule changes and emergence of guys like Tank Dell. He's got the ability to be a great receiver he needs to just keep working on his routes and getting stronger.
WR Rickey Pearsall Florida 82
size: 6'1 190, 30 3/4 arms, 9 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.41 | 3 cone - 6.64 | shuttle - 4.05 | vert - 42 | broad - 10'9 | bench - 17.
stat: 65 receptions 963 yards 4 TDs, 77.8 RECV 3% drop 5% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Has an awesome last name. One of the best catches of the year against Charrlotte. Really good hands, 3% career drop rate. Really smooth athlete, can change directions and accelerate very well. Experienced receiver that is used to finding spots in zones and helping out his QB.
cons: Not a physical receiver, needs to get stronger and get hands off him. Only ok with the ball in his hands.
take: Pearsall is a great receiver that has the hands, athleticism and route running ability to be a starting WR. He’s not the strongest though, he is similar to JSN where RAC isn’t his game, but he will still be a good receiver.
WR Troy Franklin Oregon 80
size: 6'2 176, 31 7/8 arms, 8 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - 4.41 | 3 cone - 6.9 | shuttle - 4.31 | vert - 39 | broad - 10'4 | bench - NA.
stat: 81 receptions 1,383 yards 14 TDs, 87.3 RECV 10% drop 36.8% contested
info: 21 years old.
pros: Solid production, over 1,300 yards and 80 receptions. Good long speed, can stack corners. Knows how to sit down in between zones and turn up field. Good with the ball in his hands, slippery runner. Good length, has a good catch radius.
cons: Slim frame, can get out physicaled easily. Breaks at the top of routes need work, some are sloppy. Hands are a little scary for a top receiver pick.
take: Franklyn has a lot of ability, hes got the height, speed, agility and production that will get teams excited. He’s not a polished receiver yet, he needs to add mass and work on his routes but he could end up being a great WR.
WR Javon Baker UCF 81
size: 6'1 208, 31 5/8 arms, 9 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.54 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 37 broad - 10'2 | bench - NA.
stat: 52 receptions 1,139 yards 7 TDs, 83.6 RECV 10.3% drop 56.3% contested
info: NA
pros: Former Alabama recruit, talent is there. Good athlete, has good speed to go past corners. Natural receiver, makes tough catches regularly. Sets up vertical routes very well. Good with the ball, strong runner with good agility.
cons: Real drop issue, 10% and over each of the last 3 years. Concentration on easier catches is a problem.
take: Baker is a great receiver, his YPC and ability is off the charts. He has excellent ball skills as well as athleticism. He is also strong with the ball in his hands which makes him a real WR 1 threat.
WR Jermaine Burton Alabama 79
size: 6'0 196, 31 arms, 9 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.45 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 38 1/2 | broad - 11'1 | bench - NA.
stat: 39 receptions 798 yards 8 TDs, 82 RECV 0% drop 56.3% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: True deep threat, over 20 YPC. Didn’t drop a pass in 2023. Great speed, can run right past corner backs. Good at getting out of breaks. Good body control in the air, has the ability to make the impactful down the sideline jump balls.
cons: A little skinny, doesn’t have the strength you like to see. Not a strong runner with the ball, needs to win with speed. Not a year with big time 1st round pick production.
take: Off field issues. Burton is a very talented WR, he has incredible speed and good ball skills. Not only is he a deep threat, he can run nice routes anywhere on the field and get open. Burton can immediately step in and be a WR2 in the NFL right now.
WR Keon Coleman Florida St 78
size: 6'3 213, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - 4.61 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 38 | broad - 10'7 | bench - NA.
stat: 50 receptions 658 yards 11 TDs, 70.6 RECV 3.8% drop 33.3% contested
info: 21 years old.
pros: Can make some spectacular catches. Good career drop rate, only 4% over 3 years. Ball skills are apparent, good through contact and good away from his body. Solid athlete, it shows when he has the ball in his hands.
cons: His top season never eclipsed 800 yards. Not impressive agility, start stop and sharp cuts are not his game. Releases and separation are not NFL caliber right now.
take: Coleman is a big strong receiver that has good ball skills and is good with the ball in his hands. He isn’t a polished receiver that is going to step in and dominate the NFL, he has to work on his routes and releases. He can be a good addition to a team and if it pans out he can become a WR1.
WR Jalen McMillan Washington 78
size: 6'1 197, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - 4.47 | 3 cone - 6.94 | shuttle - 4.18 | vert - 37 | broad - 20'7 | bench - NA.
stat: 45 receptions 553 yards 5 TDs, 70 RECV 10% drop 0% contested
info: 22 years old. A top 40 prospect in 2020. 2 Sport athlete, a very good baseball player too.
pros: Back to back productive years, with a 1k season in 2022. Very good speed, straight line speed is scary.
cons: Mostly worked from the slot in college, not much outside experience. Injury hurt his senior year production. Lacking some quickness in his game, not shifty. Play strength needs some work, can get bullied at the line.
take: McMillan is a very good receiver, he has the speed hands and RAC ability to be a good NFL receiver. He ran mostly out of the slot and got hurt his senior year which will hurt his draft prospect, but when he’s on the field he’s very good.  I’m going to regret rating him this low because he will be a good NFL receiver.
WR Ja’Lynn Polk Washington 78
size: 6'1 203, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - 4.52 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 37 1/2 | broad - 10'9 | bench - NA.
stat: 69 receptions 1,159 yards 9 TDs, 76.1 RECV 5.5% drop 54.2% contested
info: 22 years old. Went to Dez Bryants former HS.
pros: Good in the scramble drill, finds open space very well. Very good hands, can high point the ball and catch through contact well. Solid size and athlete, hits all the requirements. Can make guys miss after the catch. Really strong hands.
cons: Not the top-level route runner or best release package. 1 year of top level production. Speed is average, not blowing past people.
take: Polk is a very good receiver that has all the physical aspects of the game down. He’s a solid size and athlete with great hands and production. He is an NFL WR and if he continues to work on selling routes and getting in and out of breaks he will be a WR1.
WR Malachi Corley Western Kentucky 78
size: 5'11 207, 30 7/8 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - 4,56 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - 4.22 | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 79 receptions 985 yards 11 TDs, 83 RECV 7.1% drop 23.5% contested
info: 22 years old.
pros: Good YAC receiver, gets a lot of screens to him. Strong lower half, not easy to move off his spot.
cons: Doesn't catch the ball through contact very well. True receiving skills need work, releases and getting hands off.
take: Corley was the focal point of Western Kentucky. He was the main screen guy and the go to throw one up to guy. He needs to keep working on all of the aspects of being an NFL receiver, but he has the potential to be a real impact player.
WR Roman Wilson Michigan 77
size: 5'10 186, 30 1/4 arms, 9 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.39 | 3 cone - 6.89 | shuttle - 4.07 | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - 12.
stat: 48 receptions 789 yards 12 TDs, 84.5 RECV 2% drop 37.5% contested
info: 23 years old. Clocked a 4.37 in HS.
pros: Great speed, can run away once he has separation. National champion and WR1 on Michigan. Solid ball skills, hands are good and can catch away from his body.
cons: Not a strong receiver, will get pushed off routes. Not much production after the catch, not a tackle breaker.
take: Wilson was a key part of Michigans championship run. He was a leader and their top receiver showing off his hands and his elite speed. He needs to work on getting separation and strength if he wants to make an impact in the NFL though.
WR Malik Washington Virginia 76
size: 5'8 192, 30 arms, 9 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.47 | 3 cone - 6.87 | shuttle - 4.26 | vert - 42 1/2 | broad - 10'6 | bench - `9`.

cons: Only one year of production, 4 years of nothing at North Western. Smaller receiver, size is an issue. Doesn't handle physicality great, needs to get hands off him better.
take: NA
WR Brenden Rice USC 76
size: 6'2 212, 32 5/8 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.5 | 3 cone - 6.95 | shuttle - 4.45 | vert - 36 1/2 | broad - 9'11 | bench - 13.
stat: 45 receptions 791 yards 12 TDs, 79.4 RECV 4.3% drop 25% contested

cons: Not a top level RAC receiver, not very shifty or strong. Hands are average, not mossing defenders.
take: NA
WR Tez Walker North Carolina 75
size: 6'1 197, 32 3/4 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - 4.36 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - 4.3 | vert - 40 1/2 | broad - 11'2 | bench - NA.
stat: 41 receptions 699 yards 7 TDs, 68.3 RECV 6.8% drop 58.8% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Good speed, moves once he gets to full speed. Good size, big receiver with length. Good hands.
cons: Not a sudden athlete, only good linearly. Not a good separator, bad breaks and no subtle push offs. Not strong or shifty with the ball in his hands.
take: Walker is a deep threat only kind of receiver, he has good speed and can get open deep. The rest of his game isn’t great though, not much of a route runner or a YAC guy. He should get a shot and play on special teams.
WR Luke McCaffrey Rice 75
size: 6'2 198, 30 1/8 arms, 9 15/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.46 | 3 cone - 6.7 | shuttle - 4.02 | vert - 36 | broad - 10'1 | bench - NA.
stat: 71 receptions 992 yards 13 TDs, 82.6 RECV 4.1% drop 60.7% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Has some good genetics. Used to play QB so has an understanding for the WR position from that. Very good at the catch point, good hands and focus.
cons: Not a good athlete, just athletic enough to be in the NFL. Quickness and RAC aren’t his game.
take: McCaffrey isn’t the level of athlete as his brother, but they may have the same receiving level. He’s a big bodied receiver that catches the ball well and runs solid routes.
WR Johnny Wilson Florida St 75
size: 6'6 231, 35 3/4 arms, 9 1/2 hands.
test: 40 - 4.52 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 37 | broad - 10'8 | bench - NA.
stat: 41 receptions 617 yards 2 TDs, 74 RECV 10.9% drop 40% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Big bodied receiver, impossible to find this kind of size. Really good breaks at the top of routes for someone his size. Good route physicality, gets hands off easy. Great range, catch radius is huge.
cons: Not a top of the line receiver, may want to move to TE. Not a good blocker at TE right now. Start stop ability is not good for a receiver.
take: Wilson is a big bodied receiver that should move to TE, I'd draft him in the second in that case. He could be a top of the line TE if he adds size and works at it. As for WR he should be a solid rotational receiver.
WR Jalen Coker Holy Cross 75
size: 6'1 208, 32 17/8 arms, 9 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.57 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 42 1/2 | broad - 10'8 | bench - 12.
stat: 59 receptions 1,035 yards 15 TDs, 90.7 RECV 3.3% drop 52.4% contested
info: NA.
pros: Good hands, catches almost everything and through contact. Good movement skills, has some nice breaks and set up on routes. WR1 experience being the guy. Was good with the ball in his hands at his size and athleticism.
cons: Played at Holy Cross, big talent jump to the NFL. Doesn’t have the top end speed to blow past people.
take: Coker has some really nice tape where he shows everything you would want. He has to get used to the talent jump in the NFL but if he can he will be a solid NFL WR.
WR Jamari Thrash Louisville 74
size: 6'0 188, 31 arms, 8 6/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.46 | 3 cone - 7.16 | shuttle - NA | vert - 34 | broad - 10 | bench - NA.
stat: 63 receptions 855 yards 6 TDs, 78.5 RECV 11.3% drop 15.8% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Good contact balance, can get out of a lot of tackles. Solid length, good catch radius. Solid production back to back 800+ years.
cons: Hands are a real concern, drop rate and contested catch rate are not good. Not a great athlete, he’s slow in and out of routes with little twitch.
take: NA.
WR Isaiah Williams Illinois 74
size: 5'9 184, 30 1/4 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - 4.6 | 3 cone - 6.75 | shuttle - 4.11 | vert - 38 | broad - 10'8 | bench - 17.
stat: 82 receptions 1,055 yards 5 TDs, 80.9 RECV 6.8% drop 21.4% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Back to back years with 24+ MTF. Good production, 1000 yard senior season. Good athlete, has good speed and agility. Good with the ball in his hands, contact balance is great.
cons: Not the best receiver skills, plays in the slot and doesn’t have to deal with physicality.
take: Williams is a very good athlete, he is a top tier player with the ball in his hands. He hasn’t shown much with his releases, routes and high point ability. He seems like a gadget player right now but can develop to be very good.
WR Jha'Quan Jackson Tulane 74
size: 5'9 190, 30 7/8 arms, 8 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.42 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 32 | broad - 9'10 | bench - 12.

cons: Never had over 600 yards in a year, No stats that pop off the screen. Smaller receiver, not a tall or strong WR.
take: Jackson is an electric athlete, his movement skills are top notch. He lacks the hands and receiver skills to become a great WR though.
WR Cornelius Johnson Michigan 74
size: 6'2 213, 31 3/8 arms, 8 1/2 hands.

info: NA
pros: Very productive with a 1,000 yard senior season. Very quick, has great change of direction skills. Good all around athlete. Good hands.
cons: Very small, looks tiny on tape. Wont be a physical receiver, can’t deal with strong DBs. Doesn’t do many NFL type receiver skills, a lot of open slot routes.
take: Washington is a very athletic receiver with great hands. He is just small which will limit his ability to be a top end receiver.
WR Jacob Cowing Arizona 73

pros: 3 staright very productive seasons, combined for over 3k yards. Good movement skills, can run nice crisp routes and get separation early. Solid athlete, NFL speed and agility.
cons: Smaller receiver, doesn’t have the prototypical size. Ran mostly from the slot in college. Hands aren’t top tier, too many drops in his career. Not great when he has the ball, doesn’t break many tackles.
take: Cowing was a very productive receiver at Arizona, he was there captain and number one guy. He moves well for the position which shows in his routes and separation ability. His playmaking skills are lacking though, his hands and RAC are just ok so he wont be a 1 in the NFL.
