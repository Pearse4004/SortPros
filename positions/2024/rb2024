RB Blake Corum Michigan 79
size: *5'8 213, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 258 attempts 1,245 yards 27 TDs 3 Fum, 84.1 RUN 67.4 RECV 30 MFT
info: 23 years old. Corum was a 4 star out of St Frances in MD where he was the Gatorade player of the year there. Corum committed to Michigan to team up with Hassan Haskins to lead the run heavy Wolverines to new heights. With him at RB Michigan finally made the CFP in 2021 and 2022 where he was up for the Doak walker award. His junior year was good but he took of his junior year. He got hurt at the end of the season but he ran the ball 248 times for 1,461 yards and 18 TDs with a 95.9 PFF grade and 73 MTF.
pros: Great build at 5’8 210 he built perfect for an RB. Amazing burst and great vision, he is so patient for the LB to pick his path then make his cut. Change of direction is top tier, sets up defenders then goes right under them. Great contact balance, wont go down with arm tackles and by getting bumped. Runs hard, every play he will get the most amount of yards blocked for.
cons: Doesn’t have the great long speed, can get tracked down in the open field. Not a great tackle breaker, won’t be beast moding any run that not his game. Game took a step back from a historic 2022 season.
take: Corum will have an offseason without rehab going into the NFL which should help him reach his 2022 level of play. With that level, he is an RB1 and should be a top half of the league RB for his rookie contract.
RB Trey Benson Florida St 78
size: *6'1 223, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 156 attempts 905 yards 14 TDs 0 Fum, 87.3 RUN 58.6 RECV 44 MFT
info: 22 years old.
pros: Has not fumbled once. Very athletic, he has a lot of juice. Very good contact balance, strong lower half. Very fast, angle breaking speed.
cons: Not a hard nosed runner that will take what is blocked for him. Vision is questionable, not sure if he reads the play well.
take: Benson is a very talented back, he’s such a good athlete at his size it makes him hard to stop. He has too many negative plays of dancing around and not taking what is there but when he hits a crease he is gone. If a team can get him to take positive yards on wide zone he will be a top back in the league.
RB Audric Estime Notre Dame 77
size: *5'11 227, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 209 attempts 1,341 yards 19 TDs 1 Fum, 94 RUN 72 RECV 64 MFT
info: 20 years old.
pros: Big strong back with good size. Great vision, follows blockers well and sets them up. Had an incredible year with a 94 grade. Breaks tackles in a lot of ways, hurdles trucks, jukes. Runs with a good pad level and patience.
cons: Not much of a receiving threat. Doesn’t have that elite home run speed. The quicks are middle of the road
take: Estime is a big strong back with great vision and plenty of production. He wont blow anyone away with his explosiveness but that’s not his game. He’s got plenty of speed and quickness to succeed but he’s more of a power back that plays the position well.
RB Ray Davis Kentucky 77
size: *5'10 216, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 197 attempts 1,131 yards 14 TDs 1 Fum, 91.8 RUN 69.6 RECV 51 MFT
info: 24 years old.
pros: Back-to-back 1000 yard seasons. All around back, he has the speed power and agility you look for. Fights for extra yards, feet keep moving and falls forward.
cons: Transferred 3 times, not that bad but I don’t love it. Can get locked in on a man and run through them rather then take the open crease for a few more yards.
take: Davis has it all, he has no real weak points to his game. He should be able to start for an NFL team immediately and a productive NFL back.
RB Jonathon Brooks Texas 77
size: *6'0 207, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 187 attempts 1,135 yards 10 TDs 1 Fum, 91.9 RUN 75.2 RECV 63 MFT
info: 21 years old.
pros: Young back that had a 1000 yard season his first year starting. Quick and shifty back that can make guys miss 1v1. Good acceleration, once he sees space he is gone.
cons: Tore his ACL in his final season. Not a physical back, wont run through anyone.
take: Brooks finally broke out after sitting behind the best RB to come out in the last 10 years. Brooks has the juice to create explosive plays on any run with his speed and acceleration. If Brooks can bounce back from the ACL injury he will be a good NFL starter.
RB Bucky Irving Oregon 76
size: *5'10 195, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 187 attempts 1,196 yards 11 TDs 1 Fum, 90.9 RUN 74.9 RECV 68 MFT
info: 21 years old.
pros: Back-to-back 100 yard seasons. 50 plus receptions in 2023, he can be used in the pass game. Young player that has 3 years of good experience. Has the juice to make quick cuts and accelerate in an instant. Good stop start, can make guys miss and run past them. Runs hard and can break tackles with effort.
cons: Not the prototypical size, sub 200. Not going to run through any tacklers, could be an issue on goal line runs.
take: Irving is an athletic back that has good speed and agility. He was also the lead back for Oregon back to back years showing that he could carry the ball 20 times a game and still be successful. He could turn into a dynamic RB in the NFL.
RB Daijun Edwards Georgia 76
size: *5'10 200, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 164 attempts 879 yards 13 TDs 1 Fum, 80.5 RUN 69.2 RECV 38 MFT
info: NA
pros: Lead back for the last 2 years at Georgia. Electric athlete, super shifty. Fast, his acceleration is next level and can capture edges with it. Runs very hard, need to get your pads on him to take him down.
cons: Smaller back, can get eaten up by LBs and DLs. Not a short yardage back, wont push a pile or stay up running up the middle. Like to bounce it a little too much.
take: Edwards is an explosive RB, he has the game changing speed and athleticism. He may not be the big strong goal line back but if a team wants a home run threat he is the guy.
RB Dillon Johnson Washington 76
size: *6'0 218, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 233 attempts 1,189 yards 16 TDs 2 Fum, 88.5 RUN 69.1 RECV 41 MFT
info: 23 years old.
pros: A lot of receiving experience at Miss St, over 170 career receptions. Toughed his way through a national championship game with various injuries. Good speed for the size, can run away in open field. Good burst, can get through the hole quick. Runs hard, willing to lower his pads and take what is there.
cons: No elite aspect of his game, nothing is top of the NFL tier. Not a patient back, wants to hit it fast.
take: Johnson is a very good RB that has shown it all on tape. He’s got all the measurables and stats you look for to make him a starting back in the NFL.
RB Will Shipley Clemson 75
size: *5'11 205, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 167 attempts 840 yards 5 TDs 3 Fum, 76.2 RUN 74.2 RECV 27 MFT
info: 21 years old.
pros: Back to back 30+ reception years. 3 straight productive years with a 1k year in 2022. Nice shake and quickness to his game, can leave defenders whiffing in the hole. Good vision and patience, sets up blocks and accelerates through holes.
cons: Fumble issues, 7 in the last 2 years. Not a big or strong back, wont be running anyone over. Not the top end speed for his size.
take: Shipley is a very good and productive back. He has the vision and agility to make it in the NFL as a starting RB but he’s lacking the top end power and speed to put him as an elite RB.
RB Jase McClellan Alabama 75
size: *5'11 212, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 181 attempts 888 yards 8 TDs 0 Fum, 84.5 RUN 56.9 RECV 49 MFT
info: 22 Years Old.
pros: Good build, has the prototypical size. Good recruit that went to Alabama. Very good speed, can be a home run threat down the sideline. Runs hard, wont go down very easily. Solid power to his game.
cons: Only one year as the lead back. Not very sudden, not going to shake anyone out of there shoes. Doesn’t have top tier vision and patience.
take: McClellan is a big strong fast back that was RB1 at Alabama. He’s got all the tools you look for but is just missing that next level vision and shake to take his game to the next level. He can become a starting RB in the NFL but probably wont be a top of the league back.
RB Jaylen Wright Tennessee 75
size: *5'11 210, 0 arms 0 hands
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 136 attempts 1,010 yards 4 TDs 1 Fum, 91.2 RUSH 74.5 RECV 43 MTF
info: 21 years old.
pros: Young player that had a great true junior year. Solid all around back, no physical weaknesses. Great vision, seems to always get the most out of plays.
cons: One year of being a lead back. Doesn’t pop off the screen with athleticism or power.
take: Wright is an impressive young back, he’s got all the physical ability needed and the production and vision to go with it. He’s lacking the elite traits to go very high in the draft but he can be a good NFL back.
RB Cody Schrader Missouri 74
size: *5'9 214, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 277 attempts 1,611 yards 14 TDs 1 Fum, 89.2 RUN 53.6 RECV 50 MFT
info: 24 years old.
pros: No nonsense runner, wants to get north and south and get whats blocked. Great production at over 1,600 yards. Former walk on that got the starting job and stood out in the SEC. Good build, solid size, and low center of gravity.
cons: Not the most athletic back that pops off the screen. Not adding much in the receiving game.
take: Schrader worked hard to get from Truman State to Missouri where he got the starting job and didn’t let it go. He’s a strong runner that’s missing the top end talent that gets you drafted high as a RB.
RB Emani Bailey TCU 74
size: *5'9 207, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 223 attempts 1,211 yards 8 TDs 2 Fum, 88.2 RUN 65.1 RECV 68 MFT
info: 22 years old. Plays like SaRodorick Thompson.
pros: Ran for 1,200 yards and an 88 rush grade his one year starting. He has serious juice, can change direction violently. Runs very hard, not easy to get down 1 on 1.
cons: Sat behind Demarcado and Keondre Miller in 2022. The speed isn’t top tier like his change of direction. Vision can be questionable at times.
take: Bailey is a spark plug as a RB, he can come in and add juice to a running back room. He runs violently, changing direction and running his feet through contact. Bailey can be a great backup RB that comes in to change the pace of the backfield.
RB Jawhar Jordan Louisville 74
size: *5'10 185, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 181 attempts 1,123 yards 13 TDs 2 Fum, 87.3 RUN 57.9 RECV 32 MFT
info: 24 years old. Went to Syracuse before Louisville.
pros: Great speed, break away ability and hits the hole hard. Solid Shake, can change directions well without losing speed.
cons: Took until he was 24 to really break out. Vision is questionable, doesn’t read IZ well. Smaller back that looks for contact, doesn’t play to his strength.
take: Jordan is an explosive back, he has very good speed but his vision is questionable.  If he hits in the league he can do some serious damage and create explosive plays.
RB Jacory Croskey-Merritt New Mexico 74
size: *5'11 204, 0 arms 0 hands
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 188 attempts 1,191 yards 17 TDs 2 Fum, 92.8 RUSH 75.5 RECV 59 MTF
info: NA
pros: Had a breakout 2023, with a 90+ pff grade and over 1000 yards. Runs very hard, fights for each yard. Good athlete with good speed and agility. Jump cuts are sudden and explosive.
cons: Didn’t produce at alabama state and had to pump his numbers up the last 2 games at New Mexico. Can dance a little too much in the backfield.
take: Croskey-Merritt is an extremely talented back that if he played 5 years like he did his last year he would be a 2nd round pick. The question is why was he underachieving until last year. If a team picks him up he could be a home run pick.
RB Tyrone Tracy Purdue 74
size: *6'1 210, 0 arms 0 hands
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 114 attempts 714 yards 8 TDs 0 Fum, 90.5 RUSH 72 RECV 46 MTF
info: Gatorade PoY in Indiana
pros: Played WR so is versitile out of the back field. Has a good feel for running the ball and making guys miss.
cons: Played for 6 years in college with only 1 productive year. Not a powerful back, wont run through any backers. Needs to work on reading keys and vision still.
take: Tracy is a raw RB but he has the natural ability to make people miss. He has a little Rashad White in him, a solid receiving threat and a natural ability to run the ball.
RB Braelon Allen Wisconsin 73
size: *6'2 245, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 181 attempts 982 yards 12 TDs 4 Fum, 78.6 RUN 61 RECV 49 MFT
info: 20 years old.
pros: 3 years of nearly or more than 1000 yards. Not going to be arm tackled, too strong for that. Good vision, sees the blocks well and picks the correct hole. Strong legs, hard to bring down and can push piles.
cons: 9 fumbles in his career. Not a good athlete, not going to be scary in open field. Can dance too much instead of putting head down and going.
take: Allen is a old school workhorse RB. He’s got the vision and power that translates to every scheme, but he doesn’t offer much more than down hill running. He's an ok athlete which will probably prevent him from being a top RB.
RB Frank Gore Southern Miss 73
size: *5'8 195, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 229 attempts 1,119 yards 10 TDs 3 Fum, 90.2 RUN 64.6 RECV 63 MFT
info: 22 years old. Son of Frank Gore.
pros: Back to back years of 90+ PFF rush grades and over 2,400 yards combined. Makes a lot of people miss, had a year of 83 MTF. Good athlete, can change direction very easily to get to open space. Played on a horrible team and still played well.
cons: Small back, not going to run through contact well. Played a lower level of competition.
take: Gore isn’t like his dad, he doesn’t have much power to his game but he gets it done a different way. He’s got the start and stop ability to go with great change of direction. He should be able to contribute to an NFL RB room.
RB Kimani Vidal Troy 73
size: *5'8 218, 0 arms 0 hands
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 295 attempts 1,661 yards 14 TDs 2 Fum, 93.7 RUSH 62.5 RECV 92 MTF
info: 22 years old.
pros: Forced 92 missed tackles, an unreal number. Good stocky build, runs with a low center of gravity. Good vision and feel for blocks, makes the right decision more times than not.
cons: Not a sudden player, doesn’t make people whiff. Not a top level athlete, not scary in the open field.
take: Vidal is a solid back, he dominated the bad competition and held his own against Power 5 defenders. He is lacking the high level athleticism but he has everything else. He runs similar to Javonte Williams so if a team wants a back like him Vidal is your guy.
RB MarShawn Lloyd USC 72
size: *5'9 210, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 115 attempts 816 yards 9 TDs 3 Fum, 87.2 RUN 62.8 RECV 47 MFT
info: 23 years old.
pros: Top 10 RB recruit. Very good athlete, Has great burst and good speed. Runs hard, doesn’t get tackled very easily.
cons: Fumbling issue, 8 fumbles in 290 carries. Not a powerful back, will struggle running inside the tackle box.
take: Lloyd is a very athletic back with top tier burst. He has his fumbling issues and he isn’t a prototypical north south runner but he should be in a running back rotation.
RB Isaiah Davis South Dakota St 70
size: *6'1 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 236 attempts 1,578 yards 18 TDs 1 Fum, 94.6 RUN 65.3 RECV 78 MFT
info: NA
pros: 3,000 yards in the last 2 years and 4 straight 90+ Rush grades. 150 MTF in the last two years, not an easy back to bring down. Career 6.7 YPC, dominated the FCS level. Good size, big strong back. Good patience and vision, very reliable runner.
cons: Played in the FCS, level of competition will be a big jump. Speed is lacking, not going to run away from anyone.
take: Davis is a solid back that has dominated the FCS level for 4 years. He has the vision, patience, and production to get him into the league. He’s just lacking the top end athleticism to be a plus NFL starter.
RB Miyan Williams Ohio St 68
size: *5'9 226, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 142 attempts 825 yards 14 TDs 0 Fum, 91.1 RUN 52.3 RECV 48 MFT
info: 22 years old.
pros: Has never fumbled in his career. Strong runner, lower center of gravity and strong legs.
cons: Lack of total production. Season ending injury in 2023. Not a receiving threat. Not a top of the line athlete, quicks and speed are ok
take: Williams is a classic power back, not much flash to his game. He was never the lead guy for OSU which doesn’t translate well to being a starting RB. He could carve out a RB 2/3 role in the NFL.
RB Jarveon Howard Alcorn St 68
size: *5'10 200, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 250 carries 1,239 yards 12 TD 77.1 RUN.
info: NA.
pros: 68 MTF in 2022. Got better every year and dominated the first year he got a shot. Runs hard with very good contact balance. Good burst, he explodes into contact and through the line.
cons: Couldn’t get on the field at Syracuse. Not a top tier athlete, he doesn’t have the great agility or top speed. Questionable vision, doesn’t look to set up blockers and give them time to set up.
take: Howard was a top back in the SWAC this year, getting 1,239 yards and 68 MTF. He’s a tackle breaker that runs angry and with good contact balance. He’s not the level of athlete to be drafted high or the vision to be an RB one, but he has a shot of making the roster as the 3rd back.
RB Dylan Laube New Hampshire 68
size: *5'10 208, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 161 attempts 745 yards 9 TDs 2 Fum, 72.4 RUN 86.7 RECV 29 MFT
info: NA
pros: True receiving threat, 68 receptions as a senior. Ok athlete, enough speed to be in the NFL. Good vision sets up defenders to be wrong.
cons: Played against a very low level of competition. Not physically elite, doesn’t have plus anything.
take: Laube was a productive solid back for New Hampshire. He has good vision and some good ability but it is a massive jump in level of competition.
RB Jaden Shirden Monmouth 68
size: *5'9 195, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 220 attempts 1,460 yards 10 TDs 1 Fum, 83.1 RUN 61.7 RECV 39 MFT
info: NA
pros: 1 fumble in 500 attempts. Back to back 1,400+ years with an average of 7.4 YPC. Solid athlete, has good agility a solid speed.
cons: Played against lower level competition. Not a strong runner, wont put the pads down and drive forward.
take: Shirden is an athletic productive back that dominated the FCS level. The jump to the NFL will be big for him but he should get a shot at it.
RB Kendall Milton Georgia 67
size: *6'1 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 121 attempts 790 yards 14 TDs 0 Fum, 89.6 RUN 55.9 RECV 30 MFT
info: 22 years old.
pros: Strong back with good size, can push a pile.
cons: 11 career receptions, not a threat. Not much of an athlete, speed is ok but he has no agility.
take: Milton has the size and strength but being a good RB in the league may be a stretch. He plays a little high with no shake to his game.
RB Geno Hess Southeast Missouri St 66
size: *5'8 225, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 187 attempts 1,017 yards 10 TDs 3 Fum, 80.1 RUN 67 RECV 56 MFT
info: NA
pros: 3 straight 1k yard seasons. Solid vision and runs well through contact.
cons: No athleticism to speak of.
take: Hess is an accomplished RB but his athleticism is not on par to be in the NFL.
