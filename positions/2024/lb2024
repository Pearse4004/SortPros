stat: 53 tackles 7 sacks 2 INT 2 PBU, 80.4 RDEF 62.5 TACK 78.7 PRSH 82 COV
info: 21 years old. Trotter is the son of former 4 time pro bowl LB Jeremiah Trotter Sr. He was destine to be a LB and that was apparent in HS where he was a high 4 star recruit and led his HS to win 2 straight state championships. He chose to commit to Clemson along side the number 1 LB recruit Barret Carter in 2020. After sitting his freshman year he became the starter in 2022 where he broke out, leading the team in tackles and being named 2nd team All American.
pros: Violent tackler, will try to take your head off. Great diagnosis in the run game, see’s the blocking concept and gets to his spot. Can take on blockers well and shed blocks. True LB, wont have a massive learning curve to play LB in the NFL.
cons: Not the best athlete, not that sideline to sideline backer. Coverage is ok, he doesn’t move in space as well as you would like.
take: Trotter plays like an old school LB, he likes to line up in the middle of the defense read his keys and play physically. He doesn’t have the top end speed that gets you drafted in the 1st round but he is a solid 2 down LB that can play in the NFL now.
