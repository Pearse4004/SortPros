QB Jayden Daniels LSU 94
size: 6'3 210, 31 5/8 arms, 9 1/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 40 TD 4 INT 3,811 yards 71.1%, 92 PASS 92.4 RUN 29 BTT 7 TWP
info: 23 years old. Daniels was 3rd ranked QB prospect in 2019 out of Cajon HS in CA behind Bo Nix and Spencer Rattler. He committed to Arizona State to play for Herm Edwards but after he got fired he ended up transferring to LSU with Brian Kelly to help bring them back to prominence. He came in and immediately played at a high level with both his arms and legs. He threw for 2,566 yards with 15 TDs and rushed for 1,003 yards his first year with the Tigers.
pros: 2023 Heisman winner with a fantastic senior season. Doesn’t turn the ball over, he is very careful with it. Very good runner, he forces missed tackles at a very high level for a QB. Has a great quick release, effortless throwing motion and can push it down the field. Great pocket movement, very quick feet and great escape ability. Turned it on his finial year, accuracy and managed the offense at a high level.
cons: Built like a twig, not enough muscle on his frame. A little toesy when throwing, would like a quitter base. Doesn’t read the field well to find open receivers in progressions at a top tier level. Looks to run when the initial read is gone instead of extending plays to find open recievers. His Receivers were top tier and made him look better than an equal QB with a worst supporting cast.
take: Daniels is a talented QB that is a great runner with a solid arm and release. He needs a better base and to look to throw when extending plays but everything is there. He’s a dynamic athlete that has the accuracy and mind to play in the NFL right now and be a plus starter.
QB Caleb Williams USC 93
size: 6'1 214, 32 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 30 TD 5 INT 3,647 yards 68%, 84.6 PASS 82.6 RUN 27 BTT 18 TWP
info: 22 years old. Williams was a high 5-star recruit out of Gonzaga HS which is in Washington DC where he had his choice of where he wanted to play. He was set on playing with Lincon Riley because he chose OU where they had the Heisman favorite Spencer Rattler already after his great freshman season. After half a season of waiting his turn OU put him in the lineup and the rest is history. He was named a 2021 True freshman all American and was thought of as one of the best QBs in the country. After that season he followed his head coach to USC where he teamed up with the former bilitnikof award winner Jordan Addison to bring USC back to relevance. That’s exactly what happened as he lead USC to the playoff hunt before falling just short in their conference championship game.
pros: Came in as a true freshman and threw for 1,912 yards and 21 TDs with a 91.3 PFF grade. Won the Heisman as a sophomore with an absurd 4,539 yards and 42 TDs with a 91.6 PFF grade. Natural thrower of the football, the ball comes out so easy and goes where he wants it. Has the ability to create on his own, his escabability is very good. Short accuracy is on another level, perfect ball every time. Can throw some fastballs in the intermediate game, the ball gets there on time. Good athlete, can run the read option and is a threat scrambling. Pocket movement is excellent, when forced to move in there he’s super quick. Sturdy build and tough kid, he can take hits and play through pain. Impressive arm angle throws scattered throughout the tape.
cons: Not the prototypical 6’3+ QB, slightly shorter than you want. A little to happy to throw off platform, needlessly does it too often and either drifts or jumps. Can get his eyes down on the rush sometimes, needs to be able to deliver a ball as the rush is getting there. Deep ball accuracy needs work, sometime looks like underthrows and other touch passes are way off. Too many fumbles and not careful enough with the ball scrambling. Doesn’t play the traditional QB position at a high level, doesn’t anticipate and progress like an NFL QB now.
take: Williams is a playmaker in every sense of the word. He can do it with his legs and has natural arm talent to make nearly every throw. He still needs to become a more heads up player and clean up some sloppy habits, but once he does he will be unstoppable.
QB Drake Maye North Carolina 91
size: 6'4 223, 32 1/4 arms, 9 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 24 TD 9 INT 3,608 yards 63%, 89.1 PASS 73.8 RUN 34 BTT 10 TWP
info: 21 years old. Maye was a top 10 QB recruit out of Myers Park in Charlotte NC where he was the North Carolina player of the year and a great basketball player averaging a double double. His college choice was pretty easy for him, he chose to stay local and go to UNC where his brother Luke was a great basketball player from 2015-2019. His true freshman year he backed up NFL QB Sam Howell before winning the QB battle in 2022 and taking the ACC by storm.  He threw for 4,293 yards and 37 TDs and ended up taking home piles of trophies such as ACC OPOY and ACC Rookie of the year.
pros: Good size, looks the part of an NFL QB with all the physical ability. Has scramble ability to get extra yards when the routes are covered. Has the ability to escape pressure and make throws on the run. Has a very good deep ball, effortless throwing motion and good accuracy. Does a solid job scanning the field and working through progressions. Nice quick release, just a flick of the wrist. Throws with great touch, can layer the ball over LBs. Can make throws off platform that are accurate, he has good arm talent.
cons: Feet patter a lot, gets over eager and the feet get very happy and too narrow. Holds the ball with one hand way too often, needs to take better care of the ball. Would like to have a wider base, can get heel clicky. Inconsistent accuracy, too many way misplaced passes. Drifts in the pocket too often, goes into rushers when waiting to throw to the sideline. Sometime the velocity on routes over the middle are lacking. Inconsistent seeing the field, has lapses where he gets locked in on a route and doesn’t see the hole in the defense. Doesn’t lead receivers well enough, a tad late and doesn’t allow them to catch in stride. Too many mental mistakes down the field, tries to throw off platform into coverage too much.
take: Maye is a talented young quarterback that can develop into an elite quarterback. He flashes great processing speed, great accuracy and arm strength as well as a good ability to run with the ball. He’s inconsistent, if he could string it together, he will be a force in the NFL and a franchise QB.
QB Michael Penix Washington 90
size: 6’2 213, 33 5/8 arms, 10 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.68 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 36 1/2 | broad - 10'5 | bench - NA.
stat: 36 TD 11 INT 4,907 yards 65.5%, 90.2 PASS 70.2 RUN 41 BTT 11 TWP
info: 23 years old. Penix was a 3 star recruit out of Tampa Bat Tech and chose to take his talents to Indiana. He was a team captain for them and a playmaker serving as team captain in 2020 and 2021. He transferred to Washington and had an all time season, he threw for 4,354 yards and 29 touchdowns and was named the comeback player of the year.
pros: Team captain for 2 different teams. Serious arm talent, does a great job with ball placement especially down the field. Keeps the ball out of harms way, has a low turnover worthy play rate. Great at throwing on the run and off platform. Good athlete that can make things happen with his legs. He is a gun slinger, will chuck it deep as many times as he can trusting his guys. Ridiculous big time throws, happens all the time.
cons: Tough National championship game. He’s a lefty, don’t like the way his throwing motion looks. 4 straight years of injuries to start his career. His base isn’t that good, he is a little toesy and doesn’t set all the time. Has the legs but doesn’t use them in the run game. Team was great, may have inflated his stats. Lack of drop back over the middle anticipation throws.
take: Penix has it all, he has so much experience to go along with his arm talent and athleticism. He combines pushing the ball down field without putting it in harms way at an elite level. He needs to adjust to an NFL offense but he has all the tools to make it happen.
QB JJ McCarthy Michigan 85
size: 6'2 219, 31 5/8 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - 6.82 | shuttle - 4.23 | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 22 TD 4 INT 2,991 yards 72.1%, 87.9 PASS 78 RUN 20 BTT 11 TWP
info: 21 years old. Top QB recruit that won a national championship.
pros: Lead Michigan to the first National Championship of the decade. Impressive stat lines and PFF grades for the last 2 years. Love the throwing motion and the accuracy on quick passes. Solid runner for the position, can add him in the run game. Good off platform and on the run.
cons: Wasn't a tractor, more of a trailer. I don’t know what he’s seeing or thinking some times, just passes up good throws for bad ones. Lack of anticipatory throws.
take: McCarthey is a very talented QB with great accomplishments to go along with it. He is a solid athlete with a good arm that plays with good mechanics. It comes down to his mental game, there are too many head scratching non throws that I don’t know can be fixed. He could be a great backup right now though and develop into a starter.
QB Bo Nix Oregon 79
size: 6'2 214, 30 7/8 arms, 10 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 45 TD 3 INT 4,450 yards 77.3%, 92.5 PASS 70 RUN 22 BTT 5 TWP
info: 24 years old.
pros: Improved every year reaching elite PFF grading. 60 Career Starts, very experienced. Set records at Oregon and in HS being Alabama Gatorade player of the year. Great completion percentage, good at keeping the offense in rhythm. Solid size and good athlete, looks like an NFL QB. Can throw off platform to make plays out of pocket. Good decision maker, very calm and makes the correct decisions. Very good at protecting the ball, 3 INTs and only 5 TWP.
cons: Was awful at Auburn to start his career. Low average depth of target, didn’t push the ball down the field too much. Arm isn’t anything special, power is NFL average and accuracy is only solid. Lot of fade away throws, he has good mechanics but needs to use them consistently.
take: Nix is a very experienced QB that has the tools to play at the NFL level. He should be able to start right away and contribute, but his ceiling is only so high with his arm being only average and just being a solid runner.
QB Spencer Rattler Oklahoma 76
size: 6'0 211, 31 1/8 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - 4.95 | 3 cone - 7.21 | shuttle - 4.37 | vert - 32 | broad - 9 | bench - NA.
stat: 19 TD 8 INT 3,183 yards 68%, 72.7 PASS 74.1 RUN 11 BTT 11 TWP
info: 23 Years old. Rattler was a 5 star recruit out of Pinnacle in Phoenix AZ and committed to Oklahoma in 2019. He sat one year behind Jalen Hurts seeing playing time in three games attempting only 11 passes. 2020 was the first time he got starting action and he thrived with a PFF passing grade of 92.5 throwing for 3000 yards. 28 TDs and 7 INTs. In the 2020 season he initially struggled a little getting benched against Texas and put back in which was the turning point in the season for Oklahoma. His 3rd year a similar situation happened against Texas, he was benched again because of poor play.
pros: Top QB recruit. Arm talent is very apparent, has good power from any platform. Has some good athleticism to him, can move in the pocket and run with the ball. Good feet in the pocket, cleaned up his footwork and plays from a nice base.
cons: Always will have some bone head decisions where he doesn’t see a defender. Not the ideal QB size, a little small. Still needs to work on find the open man, sometimes gets locked on one receiver.
take: Rattler is a very talented QB, he was a 5 star that was thought of as a top 5 pick after his freshman year. He flashes that ability all the time but you also see why he wasn’t a top 5 pick in the last 2 years. He needs to continue to get better because the tools are there and he plays the game well, he just needs to take it to the next level.
QB Jordan Travis Florida St 73
size: 6'1 203, 31 3/8 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 20 TD 2 INT 2,755 yards 63.7%, 84.0 PASS 72.5 RUN 19 BTT 8 TWP
info: 23 years old. Travis was a 3 star recruit out of Benjamin HS in FL where he didn’t receive many looks by power 5 teams so he went with Louisville. He didn’t play much, he backed up Jwan Pass and Malik Cunningham and transferred closer to home after the season. He was then the backup to James Blackman before taking over the starting role in 2020. He had a very good 2021-2022 season combining for 4,300 yards and 37 TDs. His final season started off great, he was inline to lead the undefeated Noles to the ACC championship before a bad ankle injury ended his season.
pros: Good ability to throw off platform and make plays. Good quickness, can evade rushers well and move in the pocket well. Good accuracy, some high level ball placement on tape. Good runner, he is a threat to run. Trusts his guys and throws with anticipation.
cons: Not the best follow through, doesn’t finish towards the throw. Arm strength isn’t the best, doesn’t have a great arm. Unsure about some of his throws translating to the NFL, doesn’t see the entire field at an elite level (NFL players would make him pay for some throws). Feet can get a little happy, needs to play with a better base in areas. Bad ankle injury to end his college career.
take: Travis is a very athletic playmaking QB who is a top tier college QB. He’s got some very good accuracy downfield and can throw with nice touch. His issues come with his size and arm strength, he doesn’t have the big arm you look for in high upside QBs. He should be given a chance at a starting QB spot in the NFL but you don’t want to throw all your eggs in his basket.
QB Michael Pratt Tulane 73
size: 6'2 216, 30 3/4 arms, 9 1/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - 7.2 | shuttle - 4.23 | vert - 36 | broad - 9'6 | bench - NA.
stat: 22 TD 5 INT 2,405 yards 65.4%, 75.5 PASS 71.4 RUN 19 BTT 14 TWP
info: 22 years old.
pros: Good size, well built with solid height. Good arm, can push the ball down field. Solid accuracy all over the field. Good base, strong feet in the pocket.
cons: Level of competition will be a big jump in the NFL. Not the best at finding the best matchup and getting to the open receiver.
take: Pratt is a well built QB with the arm to make it in the NFL. It will be a solid jump in skill level at the NFL but he could be an NFL starter in time.
QB Joe Milton Tennessee 72
size: 6'5 236, 33 1/8 arms, 10 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.63 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 35 | broad - 10'1 | bench - NA.
stat: 20 TD 5 INT 2,809 yards 64.7%, 71 PASS 78 RUN 12 BTT 8 TWP
info: 24 Years Old.
pros: Create a player build from madden, looks the part with his size athleticism and arm strength. Strongest arm I’ve ever seen, absolute cannon on him. Good runner, can move in space and has size to take on DBs. Pretty accurate, not missing open targets.
cons: 1 year starter at 24 years old, 5 years as a backup. Throws with no anticipation, relies on his arm strength. Not much touch on his throws, struggles when trying to lay a ball over the top of someone.
take: Milton is a freak, he is the closest thing to Josh Allen that has come out of college. He would be a top 10 pick if this was his true junior year, but if his anticipation and reading the field ability is sub par by year 6 in college it would be surprising if he figures it out in the NFL.
QB Carter Bradley South Alabama 71
size: 6'3 213, 32 1/8 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.85 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 33 1/2 | broad - 9'6 | bench - NA.
stat: 19 TD 7 INT 2,650 yards 67.4%, 61.8 PASS 73.8 RUN 10 BTT 12 TWP
info: NA.
pros: Has a great arm, serious zip is on the ball. Good feet in the pocket, moves well and keeps a strong base. Gets through the progressions fast. Solid pocket evasion skills.
cons: Touch passes are far and few between, needs to work on that rather than always throwing fastballs. Not much of a rusher, just an ok athlete. Short accuracy is bad because of the velocity. Accuracy is inconsistent.
take: Bradley has a cannon on him, he has a very strong arm and loves to use it. He also works the pocket pretty well and can get through his reads. He’s lacking the accuracy and athleticism to be drafted as a teams QB 1, but with development he can carve out a good career.
QB Devin Leary Kentucky 70
size: 6'1 215, 30 7/8 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 25 TD 12 INT 2,750 yards 56.1%, 69.8 PASS 66.8 RUN 17 BTT 23 TWP
info: 24 years old.
pros: 1,400+ career drop backs, very experienced. Elite arm strength, throws absolute heaters. Solid at creating with his legs, can evade sacks. Solid accuracy.
cons: Peaked in 2021 and dropped off after that. Too many throws in harms way a little too loose with the ball.
take: NA
QB Taulia Tagovailoa Maryland 69
size: 5'11 185, 30 3/4 arms, 9 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 25 TD 11 INT 3,386 yards 66%, 74.7 PASS 70.6 RUN 25 BTT 20 TWP
info: 24 years old
pros: Had a year with a 90 PFF grade. Solid accuracy, very good in the underneath game and can push the ball with accuracy. Has mobility to extend plays.
cons: Small QB, sub 6 foot. Gets caught staring at one receiver too much, not any eye manipulation. Athletically and arm talent isn’t elite to make up for size.
take: Taulia has the better arm out of him and his brother, but the anticipation isn’t at the elite level Tua’s is. Taulia has a solid arm and is a solid athlete who throws with accuracy and anticipation but he doesn’t have the calling card to make him elite. He could stick around as a good backup and even run an offense as a starter if needed.
QB John Rhys-Plumlee UCF 69
size: 6'0 200, 30 1/2 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - 4.54 | 3 cone - 6.96 | shuttle - 4.27 | vert - 36 1/2 | broad - 10'4 | bench - NA.
stat: 15 TD 8 INT 2,300 yards 62.9%, 84 PASS 78.1 RUN 18 BTT 10 TWP
info: 23 years old.
pros: Very good pff grade, 89.9 offensive grade in 2023. Good athlete, can be a part of the run game and extend plays. Throws the ball in good spots down the sideline, puts back shoulder throws on the money.
cons: Had to transfer from Ole Miss, couldn’t win the job. Smaller QB at 6 foot flat. Arm is just ok, not a special arm talent.
take: NA
QB Garrett Shrader Syracuse 69
size: 6'5 231, 32 3/4 arms, 9 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 13 TD 6 INT 1,693 yards 63.1%, 69.6 PASS 77.6 RUN 9 BTT 13 TWP
info: 23 years old. Shrader was a 4 star recruit and a top 10 dual threat QB in 2019 where he mistakenly chose Mississippi State over Syracuse. As a true freshman he played a little bit getting 3 SEC starts and 203 dropbacks. He threw for 1,168 yards with 8 TD and 5 INT before deciding to enter the transfer portal to go to the red hot Syracuse Orange to be there starter. He struggled a bit his first season at cuse with 12 TWP and only 9 BTT but he turned it around in 2022. He had a very good 2022 season throwing for 2,650 yards and 17 TDs with a 64% completion percentage and adding value on the ground. Short and intermediate accuracy is pretty good, good ball placement.
pros: Very good runner, have to account for him scrambling and he’s a threat in the run game. Good feet, solid base the entire time and throws from a good base. Tough, willing to take hits.
cons: Not a very pleasing throwing motion, doesn’t look smooth. Looks to scramble too fast, not patient with his eyes down the field. Inconsistent accuracy, too many balls that don’t let receivers run with it. Arm strength is average at best. Doesn’t process and see the field at a high level, too many missed open WRs. A lot of RB swings and screen passes in the offense, not a very translatable offense.
take: Schrader plays hard and wills his offense forward at times, he’ got the ability to take over the offense. Unfortunately he’s no the best at executing the offense, he misses a lot of open receivers and doesn’t play with great anticipation. He could be a good 3rd string QB.
QB Theo Day Northern Iowa 68
size: 6'5 224, 33 arms, 10 hands.
test: 40 - 4.81 | 3 cone - 7.25 | shuttle - 4.53 | vert - 35 | broad - 9'5 | bench - NA.
stat: 16 TD 15 INT 2,864 yards 60.1%, 80.3 PASS 53.6 RUN 24 BTT 23 TWP
info: NA
pros: Good size and athlete. Elite 2022 season. Solid arm strength. Good pocket movement.
cons: Accuracy can be an issue. Step back in 2023.
take: NA
QB Sam Hartman Notre Dame 68
size: 6’1 210, 31 3/8 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - 4.7 | 3 cone - 7.21 | shuttle - 4.34 | vert - 28 1/2 | broad - 8'10 | bench - NA.
stat: 24 TD 8 INT 2,696 yards 62.3%, 79.8 PASS 57.3 RUN 25 BTT 14 TWP
info: 24 years old. Hartmans story has been well documented as he appeared on the Show QB1 playing at Oceanside in SC. He was a 3 star recruit and committed to play at wake forest where he backed up John Wofford for his first couple of years. By his 4th year he was the full time starter and by the end of his 5th year he was the best QB Wake has ever had. He threw for 11,859 yards over his 5 years with 99 TDs and back to back All Conference seasons.
pros: Very experienced and has a high pedigree. A lot of RPO experience, was asked to make a lot of decisions. Throws a good touch pass over the middle and seam. Goes through progressions fast to scan the entire field.
cons: Going to be an old rookie, 25 by week 1. Not the best athlete, wont be able to scare people with the run and isn’t a real scramble threat. Arm isn’t special, not many wow throws with plus accuracy and velocity.
take: Hartman has a lot of experience with 1,907 career attempts and 15,670 yards. He's seen it all and it shows by the way he can get through progressions and run an offense. He doesn’t have that next level arm or athleticism though, which will put a ceiling on his career where he needs a good supporting cast to be a plus starter.
QB Kedon Slovis BYU 68
size: 6'2 214, 31 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 12 TD 6 INT 1,717 yards 57.5%, 68.7 PASS 66 RUN 12 BTT 12 TWP
info: Coming out of Desert Hill in Arizona Slovis committed to USC to backup JT Daniels. After Daniels got hurt in the season opener Slovis became one of five true freshman USC quarterbacks to start a game for the trojans. He had a great true freshman year and was the PAC 12 Freshman of the year as well as made freshman All-American. He played solid his sophomore year earning an 80 PFF grade while throwing 17 TDs and 7 INTs.
pros: Moves in the pocket well. Feet are always in a good position. Shown ability to go through full field reads. Finds the checkdown well. Throws against the blitz well. Solid accuracy underneath.
cons: Doesn’t have a good arm. Threw a lot of outs that wouldn’t work in the NFL. Puts the ball in harm’s way too much.
take: Slovis has shown the ability to go through multiple reads and get the ball out of his hand. The only issue is his arm strength doesn’t compare to top quarterbacks in the NFL which limits his ceiling. Reminds me a little of Josh Rosen.
QB Jack Plummer Louisville 68
size: 6'4 220, 32 1/4 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 21 TD 12 INT 3,198 yards 64%, 73.9 PASS 59.1 RUN 19 BTT 16 TWP
info: 24 years old.
pros: Good ideal size, looks like the prototype. Throws the ball with good touch, very catchable ball. Can move in the pocket and extend, not a statue.
cons: Not a great athlete, will run but wont be a big threat. Arm strength is only ok, dont see much velocity.
take: NA
QB Frank Harris UTSA 68
size: *6'0 205, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 18 TD 8 INT 2,501 yards 64.3%, 76.8 PASS 77.3 RUN 12 BTT 10 TWP
info: 24 Years old.
pros: 3 very good years at UTSA grading over 80 in all 3. Solid runner, can scramble and be dangerous in open field. Accurate, puts the ball on the money especially in the quick game.
cons: Smaller QB, under 6 foot. Lefty, don’t like the look. Bad feet in the pocket, loses his base. Arm strength isn’t NFL average.
take: Harris had a great college career and deserves a shot in training camp. He’s accurate and a good athlete, but his size and arm strength will be tough to overcome.
QB Austin Reed Western Kentucky 68
size: 6'1 220, 30 1/8 arms, 9 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.82 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 31 TD 11 INT 3,338 yards 61.6%, 67.1 PASS 71.3 RUN 21 BTT 19 TWP
info: 24 years old.
pros: Had a great 2022 season with a PFF grade of 79.7 and throwing for 4,744 yards. NFL level arm, has the arm strength to make it in the NFL. Solid movement in the pocket.
cons: Not an accurate passer, way too many missed short throws. Didn’t run a real offense, screens and plays off screens for the majority of his passes.
take: NA
QB Brennan Armstrong NC State 68
size: 6'1 200, 31 3/4 arms, 9 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.76 | 3 cone - 7.09 | shuttle - 4.38 | vert - 31 | broad - 9'7 | bench - NA.
stat: 11 TD 7 INT 1,783 yards 60.6%, 72.5 PASS 71.2 RUN  10 BTT 7 TWP
info: 24 years old. Armstrong was born in Shelby Ohio where he was a dominate QB for his HS and was a 3 star prospect after leading his team to a 13-1 record. He garnered interest from many big 10 schools even committing to Iowa State before eventually flipping his commitment to Virginia where he enrolled in the spring. He was the backup behind one of Virginias best QB’s Bryce Perkins his first 2 years where he only played in garbage time. In his redshirt sophomore year he was named the starter as well as team captain and hit the ground running, passing for 2,114 yards and running for 677. He received a 90.3 PFF grade for that year but only led the team to a 5-5 record. His redshirt junior year he took a big step in the passing game and became more efficient. He threw for 4,429 yards with a 64.7 completion percentage and a 31 TDs with 10 INTs. He improved his grade to a 91.8 and his passing grade to a 90.3 but still went 500 going 6-6. The worst case scenario happened his final year though, he got a new coach in Tony Elliot and the offense fell off a cliff as well as Armstrongs play. His grade tanked to below a 60 and threw for 2000 less yards and only 7 TDs with 12 INTs.
pros: Solid arm strength, can make a throw to anywhere on the field. Good runner, is a threat with his legs but doesn’t rely on them heavily. Has shown good anticipation throws, splitting zones on the break of a receiver. Trust his receivers to make plays, not afraid to put it on the back shoulder or let his receivers box out defenders. Good accuracy to all levels, has solid touch on the deep ball and on intermediate routes.
cons: He’s a lefty and it always looks weird which doesn’t matter. Had 9 fumbles and 21 turnover worthy plays his best year, he has to cut down on those and protect the ball. Feet need a lot of work, doesn’t like to throw off of a good platform. A lot of weird movements in the pocket, has the ball in one hand and pumps until his guy is open. Would like to see more zone manipulation so safeties can’t get a beat on it. Needs to throw with slightly better anticipation consistently, lets defenders make up ground too often. Makes terrible decisions with the ball for no reason, just can’t make some of these throws in the NFL
take: Armstrong is a back yard football player. There needs to be more reps where you see him stand in the pocket and throw with solid timing. He has a good arm and is a good athlete but he makes some of the worst decisions with the ball that I’ve seen so that has to be cleaned up to play in the NFL.
