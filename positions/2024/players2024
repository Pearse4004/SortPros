WR Marvin Harrison Ohio St 95
size: *6'3 205, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 67 receptions 1,211 yards 14 TDs, 89.6 RECV 8.2% drop 43.3% Contested
info: 21 years old. Harrison has some top tier genetics, his father Marvin Harrison Sr was a hall of fame receiver that was one of the best to ever do it. Harrison was a 4 star recruit out of St Josephs Prep in Philly where he broke conference records for receiving. He committed to OSU over Syracuse for some reason where he sat behind Olave, Wilson and JSN as a true freshman before becoming the guy in 2022. He went for 1,263 yards and 14 TDs while being an All American and somehow snubbed for the Biletnikoff.
pros: Great size. Very good speed, can run away from defenders. Great speed off the ball, accelerates and eats space very well. Great hands, Natural catcher of the football. Ball skills are top tier, can extend away from his body to make spectacular plays. Great at setting up CBs to get them off balance. Great hands at the release, can get defenders off him easily. Press is nothing for him, great at getting off it. Great body control and can play through contact, makes for some spectacular catches.
cons: Not much of a YAC receiver, not much of a screen target receiver. Takes some routes off, you can tell when he’s not looking for the ball. Has more drops on tape than you would like. Couple reps in the Michigan game Will Johnson got the better of him.
take: Harrison is the best receiver prospect I’ve ever seen, he’s a different beast. If you don’t need a QB he should be the first player off the board in nearly every draft.
QB Jayden Daniels LSU 94
size: *6'3 200, 31 5/8 arms, 9 1/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 40 TD 4 INT 3,811 yards 71.1%, 92 PASS 92.4 RUN 29 BTT 7 TWP
info: 23 years old. Daniels was 3rd ranked QB prospect in 2019 out of Cajon HS in CA behind Bo Nix and Spencer Rattler. He committed to Arizona State to play for Herm Edwards but after he got fired he ended up transferring to LSU with Brian Kelly to help bring them back to prominence. He came in and immediately played at a high level with both his arms and legs. He threw for 2,566 yards with 15 TDs and rushed for 1,003 yards his first year with the Tigers.
pros: 2023 Heisman winner with a fantastic senior season. Doesn’t turn the ball over, he is very careful with it. Very good runner, he forces missed tackles at a very high level for a QB. Has a great quick release, effortless throwing motion and can push it down the field. Great pocket movement, very quick feet and great escape ability. Turned it on his finial year, accuracy and managed the offense at a high level.
cons: Built like a twig, not enough muscle on his frame. A little toesy when throwing, would like a quitter base. Doesn’t read the field well to find open receivers in progressions at a top tier level. Looks to run when the initial read is gone instead of extending plays to find open recievers. His Receivers were top tier and made him look better than an equal QB with a worst supporting cast.
take: Daniels is a talented QB that is a great runner with a solid arm and release. He needs a better base and to look to throw when extending plays but everything is there. He’s a dynamic athlete that has the accuracy and mind to play in the NFL right now and be a plus starter.
QB Caleb Williams USC 93
size: *6'2 210, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 30 TD 5 INT 3,647 yards 68%, 84.6 PASS 82.6 RUN 27 BTT 18 TWP
info: 22 years old. Williams was a high 5-star recruit out of Gonzaga HS which is in Washington DC where he had his choice of where he wanted to play. He was set on playing with Lincon Riley because he chose OU where they had the Heisman favorite Spencer Rattler already after his great freshman season. After half a season of waiting his turn OU put him in the lineup and the rest is history. He was named a 2021 True freshman all American and was thought of as one of the best QBs in the country. After that season he followed his head coach to USC where he teamed up with the former bilitnikof award winner Jordan Addison to bring USC back to relevance. That’s exactly what happened as he lead USC to the playoff hunt before falling just short in their conference championship game.
pros: Came in as a true freshman and threw for 1,912 yards and 21 TDs with a 91.3 PFF grade. Won the Heisman as a sophomore with an absurd 4,539 yards and 42 TDs with a 91.6 PFF grade. Natural thrower of the football, the ball comes out so easy and goes where he wants it. Has the ability to create on his own, his escabability is very good. Short accuracy is on another level, perfect ball every time. Can throw some fastballs in the intermediate game, the ball gets there on time. Good athlete, can run the read option and is a threat scrambling. Pocket movement is excellent, when forced to move in there he’s super quick. Sturdy build and tough kid, he can take hits and play through pain. Impressive arm angle throws scattered throughout the tape.
cons: Not the prototypical 6’3+ QB, slightly shorter than you want. A little to happy to throw off platform, needlessly does it too often and either drifts or jumps. Can get his eyes down on the rush sometimes, needs to be able to deliver a ball as the rush is getting there. Deep ball accuracy needs work, sometime looks like underthrows and other touch passes are way off. Too many fumbles and not careful enough with the ball scrambling. Doesn’t play the traditional QB position at a high level, doesn’t anticipate and progress like an NFL QB now.
take: Williams is a playmaker in every sense of the word. He can do it with his legs and has natural arm talent to make nearly every throw. He still needs to become a more heads up player and clean up some sloppy habits, but once he does he will be unstoppable.
QB Drake Maye North Carolina 90
size: *6'4 225, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 24 TD 9 INT 3,608 yards 63%, 89.1 PASS 73.8 RUN 34 BTT 10 TWP
info: 21 years old. Maye was a top 10 QB recruit out of Myers Park in Charlotte NC where he was the North Carolina player of the year and a great basketball player averaging a double double. His college choice was pretty easy for him, he chose to stay local and go to UNC where his brother Luke was a great basketball player from 2015-2019. His true freshman year he backed up NFL QB Sam Howell before winning the QB battle in 2022 and taking the ACC by storm.  He threw for 4,293 yards and 37 TDs and ended up taking home piles of trophies such as ACC OPOY and ACC Rookie of the year.
pros: Good size, looks the part of an NFL QB with all the physical ability. Has scramble ability to get extra yards when the routes are covered. Has the ability to escape pressure and make throws on the run. Has a very good deep ball, effortless throwing motion and good accuracy. Does a solid job scanning the field and working through progressions. Nice quick release, just a flick of the wrist. Throws with great touch, can layer the ball over LBs. Can make throws off platform that are accurate, he has good arm talent.
cons: Feet patter a lot, gets over eager and the feet get very happy and too narrow. Holds the ball with one hand way too often, needs to take better care of the ball. Would like to have a wider base, can get heel clicky. Inconsistent accuracy, too many way misplaced passes. Drifts in the pocket too often, goes into rushers when waiting to throw to the sideline. Sometime the velocity on routes over the middle are lacking. Inconsistent seeing the field, has lapses where he gets locked in on a route and doesn’t see the hole in the defense. Doesn’t lead receivers well enough, a tad late and doesn’t allow them to catch in stride. Too many mental mistakes down the field, tries to throw off platform into coverage too much.
take: Maye is a talented young quarterback that can develop into an elite quarterback. He flashes great processing speed, great accuracy and arm strength as well as a good ability to run with the ball. He’s inconsistent, if he could string it together, he will be a force in the NFL and a franchise QB.
WR Malik Nabers LSU 90
size: *6'0 200, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 89 receptions 1,568 yards 14 TDs, 92.9 RECV 5.3% drop 45.5% contested
info: 21 years old.
pros: Great speed, 2nd gear can run past DB’s. Great athlete, moves at the top of routes effortlessly without having to gear down. 30 forced missed tackles in 2023, good with the ball in his hands. Deep ball tracking is elite, focused on the ball and always comes up with it.
cons: Ball skills aren’t at an elite level. A lot of deep balls, stops, crossers and jets, needs to show more variety. Doesn’t sell his routes, he doesn’t attack DBs leverages.
take: Nabers is one of the most athletic receivers in football. His deep speed, agility and play strength are all top tier and he is great at catching the deep ball. Minimum he is a great deep threat for a team and if he gets the chance he could show that he’s a WR1 in the league.
OT Joe Alt Notre Dame 89
size: *6'7 317, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,214 career snaps 5 pressures, 86.9 RBLK 92.2 PBLK
info: Alt was a 4 star recruit out of Totino Grace in Minneapolis where he received offers from a few big 10 teams but ultimately went with the OL factory ND. He has the bloodlines to play professional ball, his dad John Alt is in the Chiefs HoF who was a pro bowl OL from Iowa. His freshman year he played some TE and by halfway through the season he took over the starting LT spot and played well. 2022 was his breakout year, he was an all American dominating in both the pass and run game only allowing 5 pressures all year.
pros: Good strong stance, good flexibility. Very smart player, picks up stunts instantly. Very good hand usage, strikes in the right spot and refits well. Great athlete, can pull well and get into space. Good mirroring ability, will rarely lose to counters and inside moves. Great at getting to the second level and washing backers away
cons: Plays off balance way too much, lunges too often and doesn’t keep his weight back. Needs to work on independent hand usage, a lot of 2 hands to the chest. He’s not a mauler, not the strongest. Crosses his feet and gets narrow too much, needs to play with a better base.
take: Alt is a very talented tackle that has the tools to be an all pro tackle. He has great athleticism too his game, he can pull and move in space at a high level as well as mirror pass rushers. His technique is pretty good for a college tackle, he does a great job refitting his hands and has good placement on strikes. He just needs to continue to develop, whether that be his strength/pad level or independent hand usage. Once he puts it all together he will be a top tier tackle in the NFL.
TE Brock Bowers Georgia 89
size: *6'4 230, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 56 receptions 717 yards 6 TDs, 87.1 RECV 62.4 RBLK 5.1% drop 22.2% contested
info: 21 years old. Bowser was a top 2 TE recruit coming out of Napa CA where he was given a 4 star rating and offers from many of the power 5 schools. He chose to go with Georgia over any school close to him in California to play in the SEC. Bowers immediately proved he was a top tight end in the nation catching 56 balls and 13 TDs as a true freshman which ended in a national championship. He kept up the high level of play in 2022 catch 63 balls for 942 yards and another National championship as well as an All American bid.
pros: Production off the charts, the top receiver on Georgia since day 1. Great ball skills, good concentration and sticky hands. Good body control, can adjust to the ball in air at a high level. Good blocker in space, good feet and dominates DBs. Great with the ball in his hands, manufactured touches for him to work in space. Good athlete, outruns LBs down the field and can hit home runs from the TE position.
cons: Not a good inline blocker, needs to add some muscle or become more aggressive. Separation with his athleticism doesn’t scare DBs, quickness isn’t elite.
take: Bowers is the second best receiving TE I’ve seen out of college. Besides Kyle Pitts, Bowers has some of the mot impressive receiving reps out of any TE in the NCAA. He’s a great athlete with very strong hands and great body control that allows him to be a receiving threat immediately in the NFL. If he can become a more willing and violent blocker he will be one of if not the best TE in the NFL.
WR Rome Odunze Washington 89
size: *6'3 215, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 92 receptions 1,640 yards 13 TDs, 89.1 RECV 3.2% drop 74.1% contested
info: 22 Years old.
pros: Has great size, 6’3 215 he’s the prototype. Great production, over 1,500 yards and 13 TDs in 2023. Catch numbers were great, only 3% drop rate and had 20 contested catches. Great concentration, can catch it with guys draped on his back. Sudden off the line, his releases are nice. Great ball tracking skills, has a knack for getting in good position. Good at the top of routes getting hands off him. Smooth mover, nice breaks on routes and can move well after the catch.
cons: Didn’t do too much his first 2 seasons at Washington. A few routes here and there where he’s not going to space or slipping. Speed isn’t top tier, not a scary deep threat with speed. Just ok with the ball in his hands.
take: Odunze is a stud, he has every tool you look for with no glaring weakness. He has fantastic ball skills and good movement skills as well as great production. The biggest thing that will hold him back is if a QB doesn’t trust him and give him the opportunities he needs to make those plays for him.
QB Michael Penix Washington 88
size: 6’2 213, 33 5/8 arms, 10 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 36 TD 11 INT 4,907 yards 65.5%, 90.2 PASS 70.2 RUN 41 BTT 11 TWP
info: 23 years old. Penix was a 3 star recruit out of Tampa Bat Tech and chose to take his talents to Indiana. He was a team captain for them and a playmaker serving as team captain in 2020 and 2021. He transferred to Washington and had an all time season, he threw for 4,354 yards and 29 touchdowns and was named the comeback player of the year.
pros: Team captain for 2 different teams. Serious arm talent, does a great job with ball placement especially down the field. Keeps the ball out of harms way, has a low turnover worthy play rate. Great at throwing on the run and off platform. Good athlete that can make things happen with his legs. He is a gun slinger, will chuck it deep as many times as he can trusting his guys. Ridiculous big time throws, happens all the time.
cons: Tough National championship game. He’s a lefty, don’t like the way his throwing motion looks. 4 straight years of injuries to start his career. His base isn’t that good, he is a little toesy and doesn’t set all the time. Has the legs but doesn’t use them in the run game. Team was great, may have inflated his stats. Lack of drop back over the middle anticipation throws.
take: Penix has it all, he has so much experience to go along with his arm talent and athleticism. He combines pushing the ball down field without putting it in harms way at an elite level. He needs to adjust to an NFL offense but he has all the tools to make it happen.
OT Taliese Fuaga Oregon St 86
size: 6'6 332, 33 3/8 arms, 10 1/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 1,565 career snaps 12 pressures, 90.9 RBLK 80 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Great independent hand usage in pass pro. Great patience, never lunges in pass pro. Strong run blocker, has the ability to throw guys off his spot. Good size, built to be an NFL OL. Picks up stunts well. Smooth in pass pro, never out of control.
cons: Plays a little high, pad level needs to be a little lower. Not a great athlete, speed on backside cut offs is lacking.
take: Fuaga is a very good tackle, he has the size, power and technique to be a day 1 starter. He has never had a bad season of football and was dominate at times. If he was more athletic he would be a top of the first round pick.
OT JC Latham Alabama 86
size: *6'6 335, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 1,891 career snaps 14 pressures, 79.6 RBLK 81.7 PBLK
info: 21 years old.
pros: Star recruit, one of the best recruits on the OL ever. Powerful run blocker, will move anyone with ease. Good independent hand usage in pass pro. Great lower half strength.
cons: Footwork can be cleaned up. May struggle with speed.
take: Latham is one of the most powerful lineman in the draft and can step in and play day one.
WR Brian Thomas LSU 86
size: *6'4 205, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 68 receptions 1,177 yards 17 TDs, 75.1 RECV 6.8% drop 53.8% contested
info: 22 years old.
pros: Unreal TD production, 17 TDs in 13 games. Very good deep threat, has the ball tracking skills to make plays down the field. Can win end zone jump balls and runs nice fades in the redzone. Good speed, can win with speed down the field.
cons: A lot of lazy routes as a product of the offense and not getting the ball. Cuts aren’t that good, not a polished receiver. Not the featured receiver in the offense.
take: Thomas is a big play threat, he wins with good speed and great ball tracking skills. He has good length to make plays on balls out side his frame. He probably will never be a true 1 but he can fit a role in an NFL receivers room right now.
OT Troy Fautanu Washington 85
size: *6'4 317, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,155 career snaps 18 pressures, 61.9 RBLK 88.2 PBLK
info: 23 years old.
pros: Built very well, he was born to be a big guy. Feet are great, very fast feet and strong base. Such a good athlete, change of direction is great. Good plays in the run game moving people down the field.
cons: Doesn’t have the best length, may have to move to guard.
take: Fautanu will be a good to great NFL OL, he is built to play OL in the NFL. He carries his weight so well and is a top tier athlete.
OT Amarius Mims Georgia 84
size: *6'7 340, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 803 career snaps 1 pressures, 68.4 RBLK 81.2 PBLK
info: 21 years old.
pros: Top recruit with the physical ability that is unteachable. Only 6 career pressures. Moves so well for his size. Powerful in the run game, moves men.
cons: Not a lot of experience, hurt most of junior year. Not enough film in 2023. Still needs development, technique is not refined in pass pro. Leans too much.
take: Mims hasn't played much college ball, but his physical ability alone is top tier. He can step in and start day one and grow into a great tackle.
WR Adonai Mitchell Texas 83
size: *6'4 196, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 55 receptions 845 yards 11 TDs, 74.1 RECV 1.8% drop 36.4% contested
info: 21 Years old.
pros: One drop in the last 2 years, very good hands. Good size for an X jump ball receiver, has good length too. Works back to the ball well, attacks it. Explosive athlete, solid speed, acceleration and vertical. Real nice subtle moves in his routes to create separation.
cons: See reps on tape where he may not have the best demeanor. Not a huge threat when the ball is in his hands.
take: Mitchell is a very talented WR, he has good size and is an explosive athlete. To go along with his physical gifts he catches the ball well and does a lot of nice things with his routes to create separation. He may not ever be a WR1 because he’s not great with the ball in his hands but he certainly should be an NFL starter.
OT Olu Fashanu Penn St 82
size: *6'6 319, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 1,349 career snaps 10 pressures, 70.5 RBLK 88.4 PBLK
info: 21 years old.
pros: Never had a bad year, especially in pass pro. Great build, size and length is prototypical. Good athlete, moves well in space. Strong punch, can shock defenders at impact. Drives his feet well, keeps them churning. Lower half is very thick, good base.
cons: Not a refined tackle, still has a lot of technique development to do. Doesn’t have independent hand usage. Feet get sloppy and crossed over at times. Too off balance too many times.
take: Fashanu looks the part in every sense of being an NFL tackle. He’s long, explosive and athletic which are all un coachable. He has to really work on his sets, feet and hand placement to reach his potential but if he does he is an All pro type talent.
WR Xavier Worthy Texas 82
size: *6'1 172, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 75 receptions 1,014 yards 5 TDs, 71.9 RECV 6.3% drop 23.8% contested
info: 21 Years Old. Elite track runner, ran a 10.55 100m. Big 12 freshman of the year.
pros: Can throw the ball 50 yards. 3 years of good production at Texas with a 900 yard freshman year. Really good speed, his 2nd gear can blow past DBs. Great athlete, smooth in every movement. Good quickness with the ball in his hands. Good return man.
cons: Some real soft plays where he can’t handle physicality. Catching the ball through contact is not his game. At his size and athleticism level, he needs to run more polished routes.
take: Worthy is a great athlete that is a little undersized. That isn’t as much of a problem as it used to be with the rule changes and emergence of guys like Tank Dell. He's got the ability to be a great receiver he needs to just keep working on his routes and getting stronger.
OT Jordan Morgan Arizona 81
size: 6'5 312, 32 7/8 arms, 10 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,404 career snaps 14 pressures, 77 RBLK 87.3 PBLK
info: 22 years old.
pros: Good pass sets, keeps a good relation from the rusher to the QB. Strong tackle, good when he gets hands on and can move people in the run game. Plays with a great base and leverage.
cons: Arm length isn’t ideal for the position. Feet are below average speed for the position in the NFL.
take: Morgan is a big strong tackle that played very well for Arizona. He doesn’t have the elite foot speed that you look for but he could find his way as a good starter in the NFL.
QB JJ McCarthy Michigan 80
size: *6'3 202, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 22 TD 4 INT 2,991 yards 72.1%, 87.9 PASS 78 RUN 20 BTT 11 TWP
info: 21 years old. Top QB recruit that won a national championship.
pros: Lead Michigan to the first National Championship of the decade. Impressive stat lines and PFF grades for the last 2 years. Love the throwing motion and the accuracy on quick passes. Solid runner for the position, can add him in the run game. Good off platform and on the run.
cons: Wasn't a tractor, more of a trailer. I don’t know what he’s seeing or thinking some times, just passes up good throws for bad ones. Lack of anticipatory throws.
take: McCarthey is a very talented QB with great accomplishments to go along with it. He is a solid athlete with a good arm that plays with good mechanics. It comes down to his mental game, there are too many head scratching non throws that I don’t know can be fixed. He could be a great backup right now though and develop into a starter.
WR Javon Baker UCF 80
size: 6'1 208, 31 5/8 arms, 9 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 52 receptions 1,139 yards 7 TDs, 83.6 RECV 10.3% drop 56.3% contested
info: NA
pros: Former Alabama recruit, talent is there. Good athlete, has good speed to go past corners. Natural receiver, makes tough catches regularly. Sets up vertical routes very well. Great with the ball, strong runner with good agility.
cons: Real drop issue, 10% and over each of the last 3 years. Concentration on easier catches is a problem.
take: Baker is a great receiver, his YPC and ability is off the charts. He has excellent ball skills as well as athleticism. He is also strong with the ball in his hands which makes him a real WR 1 threat.
WR Ladd McConkey Georgia 80
size: 5'11 187, 30 1/8 arms, 8 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 30 receptions 483 yards 2 TDs, 81.3 RECV 6.3% drop 40% contested
info: 22 years old.
pros: 2 time national champion and was the best receiver on the team. Student of the game, really good route runner. Sneaky athletic, really talented with the ball in his hands.
cons: Took a step back after a good 2022 season, missed the first few games. Hands aren’t the greatest, a couple double catches.
take: Ladd is a great receiver, he has the athletic ability paired with the routes to be a problem in the NFL. Not only that but he is great after the catch which adds a lot to his game. The only issue is he’s not the over the top talent that gets picked in round 1.
WR Keon Coleman Florida St 80
size: *6'3 215, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 50 receptions 658 yards 11 TDs, 70.6 RECV 3.8% drop 33.3% contested
info: 21 years old.
pros: Can make some spectacular catches. Good career drop rate, only 4% over 3 years. Ball skills are apparent, good through contact and good away from his body. Solid athlete, it shows when he has the ball in his hands.
cons: His top season never eclipsed 800 yards. Not impressive agility, start stop and sharp cuts are not his game. Releases and separation are not NFL caliber right now.
take: Coleman is a big strong receiver that has good ball skills and is good with the ball in his hands. He isn’t a polished receiver that is going to step in and dominate the NFL, he has to work on his routes and releases. He can be a good addition to a team and if it pans out he can become a WR1.
OT Graham Barton Duke 79
size: *6'5 314, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,569 career snaps 11 pressures, 71.2 RBLK 78.2 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Started in all 4 years with good play in them all. Really strong hands, he has a vice grip on defenders. Great base in pass pro, nice wide and strong. Good anchor, has a strong core.
cons: Not the best second level blocker against line backers. Not a plus athlete in the NFL. Can get caught leaning at times. Has the length of a guard and the build of a tackle.
take: Barton is a very good and experienced lineman that has played well every year in college. He has some good power behind his game and good technique to go with it. He is lacking in athleticism and length which will kick him inside in the NFL, but he should be able to start in the NFL very soon and be solid.
QB Bo Nix Oregon 79
size: 6'2 218, 30 7/8 arms, 9 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 45 TD 3 INT 4,450 yards 77.3%, 92.5 PASS 70 RUN 22 BTT 5 TWP
info: 24 years old.
pros: Improved every year reaching elite PFF grading. 60 Career Starts, very experienced. Set records at Oregon and in HS being Alabama Gatorade player of the year. Great completion percentage, good at keeping the offense in rhythm. Solid size and good athlete, looks like an NFL QB. Can throw off platform to make plays out of pocket. Good decision maker, very calm and makes the correct decisions. Very good at protecting the ball, 3 INTs and only 5 TWP.
cons: Was awful at Auburn to start his career. Low average depth of target, didn’t push the ball down the field too much. Arm isn’t anything special, power is NFL average and accuracy is only solid. Lot of fade away throws, he has good mechanics but needs to use them consistently.
take: Nix is a very experienced QB that has the tools to play at the NFL level. He should be able to start right away and contribute, but his ceiling is only so high with his arm being only average and just being a solid runner.
RB Blake Corum Michigan 79
size: *5'8 213, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 258 attempts 1,245 yards 27 TDs 3 Fum, 84.1 RUN 67.4 RECV 30 MFT
info: 23 years old. Corum was a 4 star out of St Frances in MD where he was the Gatorade player of the year there. Corum committed to Michigan to team up with Hassan Haskins to lead the run heavy Wolverines to new heights. With him at RB Michigan finally made the CFP in 2021 and 2022 where he was up for the Doak walker award. His junior year was good but he took of his junior year. He got hurt at the end of the season but he ran the ball 248 times for 1,461 yards and 18 TDs with a 95.9 PFF grade and 73 MTF.
pros: Great build at 5’8 210 he built perfect for an RB. Amazing burst and great vision, he is so patient for the LB to pick his path then make his cut. Change of direction is top tier, sets up defenders then goes right under them. Great contact balance, wont go down with arm tackles and by getting bumped. Runs hard, every play he will get the most amount of yards blocked for.
cons: Doesn’t have the great long speed, can get tracked down in the open field. Not a great tackle breaker, won’t be beast moding any run that not his game. Game took a step back from a historic 2022 season.
take: Corum will have an offseason without rehab going into the NFL which should help him reach his 2022 level of play. With that level, he is an RB1 and should be a top half of the league RB for his rookie contract.
WR Troy Franklyn Oregon 79
size: *6'3 187, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 81 receptions 1,383 yards 14 TDs, 87.3 RECV 10% drop 36.8% contested
info: 21 years old.
pros: Solid production, over 1,300 yards and 80 receptions. Good long speed, can stack corners. Knows how to sit down in between zones and turn up field. Good with the ball in his hands, slippery runner. Good length, has a good catch radius.
cons: Slim frame, can get out physicaled easily. Breaks at the top of routes need work, some are sloppy. Hands are a little scary for a top receiver pick.
take: Franklyn has a lot of ability, hes got the height, speed, agility and production that will get teams excited. He’s not a polished receiver yet, he needs to add mass and work on his routes but he could end up being a great WR.
WR Jermaine Burton Alabama 79
size: *6'0 194, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 39 receptions 798 yards 8 TDs, 82 RECV 0% drop 56.3% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: True deep threat, over 20 YPC. Didn’t drop a pass in 2023. Great speed, can run right past corner backs. Good at getting out of breaks. Good body control in the air, has the ability to make the impactful down the sideline jump balls.
cons: A little skinny, doesn’t have the strength you like to see. Not a strong runner with the ball, needs to win with speed. Not a year with big time 1st round pick production.
take: Burton is a very talented WR, he has incredible speed and good ball skills. Not only is he a deep threat, he can run nice routes anywhere on the field and get open. Burton can immediately step in and be a WR2 in the NFL right now.
WR Jalen McMillan Washington 79
size: *6'1 192, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 45 receptions 553 yards 5 TDs, 70 RECV 10% drop 0% contested
info: 22 years old. A top 40 prospect in 2020. 2 Sport athlete, a very good baseball player too.
pros: Back to back productive years, with a 1k season in 2022. Very good speed, straight line speed is scary.
cons: Mostly worked from the slot in college, not much outside experience. Injury hurt his senior year production. Lacking some quickness in his game, not shifty. Play strength needs some work, can get bullied at the line.
take: McMillan is a very good receiver, he has the speed hands and RAC ability to be a good NFL receiver. He ran mostly out of the slot and got hurt his senior year which will hurt his draft prospect, but when he’s on the field he’s very good.  I’m going to regret rating him this low because he will be a good NFL receiver.
WR Xavier Legette South Carolina 79
size: 6'1 223, 31 5/8 arms, 8 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 71 receptions 1,255 yards 7 TDs, 86.8 RECV 2.7% drop 47.6% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Really good size, solid frame with good height. Pretty good long speed, once he opens it up he can move. Pretty good run after catch, strong with the ball in his hands. Great at the catch point, has the ability to go up and win rebounds. Good hands, can make catches through contact and doesn’t drop many.
cons: One year production, played 4 seasons with under 500 yards total. Releases are slow, doesn’t get instantly off press. Not a separator, defenders have an easy time sticking to him. Not quick, doesn’t have the ability to change directions well.
take: Leggette is your typical jump ball big bodied receiver. He has impressive size speed and ball skills with the senior year production to go along with it. His separation ability will be questionable in the NFL especially with more physical DBs.
C Jackson Powers-Johnson Oregon 78
size: 6'3 334, 31 1/8 arms, 9 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 1,355 career snaps 1 pressures, 85.2 RBLK 90.6 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Young center that has played well in the power 5 3 straight years. Good strength, can toss players once he has his hands on them. Good athlete for 334 pounds. Can handle nose guards.
cons: One year full time starter. Needs to develop more with technique not to get tossed around. Handling speed is a question. Short arms.
take: Powers-Johnson has the potential to be a very good center. All he is missing is length, but he has the chance to be a top center in the NFL.
OG Christian Haynes Uconn 78
size: 6'3 318, 33 1/2 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - 5.03 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 33 | broad - 8'6 | bench - 25.
stat: 3,319 career snaps 12 pressures, 80.1 RBLK 82.5 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Very good athlete, he moves very well for a 300 pounder. Good anchor, strong core and has flexibility. Can reach 0 techs in zone scheme.
cons: Played at a lower level school. Not the biggest guard, a little undersized.
take: Haynes made some money at the senior bowl, he showed that he can hold up to bull rushers at his size. He is good in both the run and pass game and he should be a starter day 1 in the NFL.
OT Patrick Paul Houston 78
size: 6'7 333, 36 1/3 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,968 career snaps 9 pressures, 69.4 RBLK 91.5 PBLK
info: “Prodigy at martial arts”. Brother was Chris Paul (NFL OL).
pros: Great size and length. Back to back 91+ PFF pass blocking grade. Good feet, can move very well at his size.
cons: Likes to hold, never gets his hands inside the frame. Doesn’t have a nasty streak, just trys to get the job done. Balance is just ok, leans and can get thrown off his spot.
take: Paul is a well built tackle with the length and athleticism to be a good NFL tackle. He’s a little sloppy with his technique and can get thrown off his spot. With proper coaching he can be a good starter.
RB Trey Benson Florida St 78
size: *6'1 223, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 156 attempts 905 yards 14 TDs 0 Fum, 87.3 RUN 58.6 RECV 44 MFT
info: 22 years old.
pros: Has not fumbled once. Very athletic, he has a lot of juice. Very good contact balance, strong lower half. Very fast, angle breaking speed.
cons: Not a hard nosed runner that will take what is blocked for him. Vision is questionable, not sure if he reads the play well.
take: Benson is a very talented back, he’s such a good athlete at his size it makes him hard to stop. He has too many negative plays of dancing around and not taking what is there but when he hits a crease he is gone. If a team can get him to take positive yards on wide zone he will be a top back in the league.
WR Ja’Lynn Polk Washington 78
size: *6'2 204, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 69 receptions 1,159 yards 9 TDs, 76.1 RECV 5.5% drop 54.2% contested
info: 22 years old. Went to Dez Bryants former HS.
pros: Good in the scramble drill, finds open space very well. Very good hands, can high point the ball and catch through contact well. Solid size and athlete, hits all the requirements. Can make guys miss after the catch. Really strong hands.
cons: Not the top-level route runner or best release package. 1 year of top level production. Speed is average, not blowing past people.
take: Polk is a very good receiver that has all the physical aspects of the game down. He’s a solid size and athlete with great hands and production. He is an NFL WR and if he continues to work on selling routes and getting in and out of breaks he will be a WR1.
WR Rickey Pearsall Florida 78
size: 6'1 193, 30 3/4 arms, 9 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 65 receptions 963 yards 4 TDs, 77.8 RECV 3% drop 5% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Has an awesome last name. One of the best catches of the year against Charrlotte. Really good hands, 3% career drop rate. Really smooth athlete, can change directions and accelerate very well. Experienced receiver that is used to finding spots in zones and helping out his QB.
cons: Not a physical receiver, needs to get stronger and get hands off him. Only ok with the ball in his hands.
take: Pearsall is a great receiver that has the hands, athleticism and route running ability to be a starting WR. He’s not the strongest though, he is similar to JSN where RAC isn’t his game, but he will still be a good receiver.
WR Malachi Corley Western Kentucky 78
size: 5'11 215, 30 7/8 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 79 receptions 985 yards 11 TDs, 83 RECV 7.1% drop 23.5% contested
info: 22 years old.
pros: Good YAC receiver, gets a lot of screens to him. Strong lower half, not easy to move off his spot.
cons: Doesn't catch the ball through contact very well. True receiving skills need work, releases and getting hands off.
take: Corley was the focal point of Western Kentucky. He was the main screen guy and the go to throw one up to guy. He needs to keep working on all of the aspects of being an NFL receiver, but he has the potential to be a real impact player.
C Zach Frazier West Virginia 77
size: 6'3 314, 32 3/8 arms, 10 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - 30.

info: Top Tier wrestler.
pros: A lot of experience, 3000+ career snaps. 3 time team captain that played as a true freshman. Solid in pass pro and the run game. Can secure second level blocks. Works hard and doesn't give up on plays.
cons: Not the most physically impressive player, athleticism and strength arent special.
take: NA
OG Cooper Beebe Kansas St 77
size: 6'3 322, 31 1/2 arms, 9 1/4 hands.
test: 40 - 5.03 | 3 cone - 7.44 | shuttle - 4.61 | vert - 27.5 | broad - 9'1 | bench - 20.

pros: Over 3,000 snaps and 3 straight great years being a team captain. Strong in the run game, good pull blocker and can move NT. Solid anchor in pass pro, hard to bull rush.
cons: Athleticism doesn’t pop off the screen, not the top tier athlete.
take: Beebe is a very good guard that showed his top tier run blocking for 3 straight years. Hes a powerful guard that was meant to be in a gap scheme heavy run offense.
OT Kinglsley Suamataia BYU 77
size: 6'4 329, 34 1/4 arms, 10 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 1,342 career snaps 15 pressures, 52.9 RBLK 83.4 PBLK

pros: Former 5 star recruit and very young. Very good size, length and size are plus. Can move well for his size. Good strength, can anchor in the pass and move the line in the run.
cons: Lacking experience with only 1,300 career snaps. Raw technique, sets are sloppy and throws the same hands every time. Run blocking is average, doesn’t take great angles.
take: Suamataia has the unteachables of the position, his potential is sky high. He is very raw on tape but with a good OL coach he can be great.
OT Kiran Amegadjie Yale 77
size: *6'5 326, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: NA
pros: Great size and length. Good athlete for the size, can move. Good anchor and power to his game.

take: NA
OT Blake Fisher Notre Dame 77
size: 6'6 310, 34 3/8 arms, 10 hands.
test: 40 - 5.2 | 3 cone - 7.76 | shuttle - 4.73 | vert - 28 | broad - 9'6 | bench - NA.
stat: 1,712 career snaps 15 pressures, 69.1 RBLK 72.5 PBLK
info: 21 years old.
pros: Good size, meets all thresholds and is young. Notre Dame OL. Good athlete, fast off the line and light on his feet. Good at climbing to the second level.
cons: Leans too much from time to time, better balance. Hands aren't a high level, can be swiped.
take: NA
QB Spencer Rattler Oklahoma 77
size: 6'0 219, 31 1/8 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 19 TD 8 INT 3,183 yards 68%, 72.7 PASS 74.1 RUN 11 BTT 11 TWP
info: 23 Years old. Rattler was a 5 star recruit out of Pinnacle in Phoenix AZ and committed to Oklahoma in 2019. He sat one year behind Jalen Hurts seeing playing time in three games attempting only 11 passes. 2020 was the first time he got starting action and he thrived with a PFF passing grade of 92.5 throwing for 3000 yards. 28 TDs and 7 INTs. In the 2020 season he initially struggled a little getting benched against Texas and put back in which was the turning point in the season for Oklahoma. His 3rd year a similar situation happened against Texas, he was benched again because of poor play.
pros: Top QB recruit. Arm talent is very apparent, has good power from any platform. Has some good athleticism to him, can move in the pocket and run with the ball. Good feet in the pocket, cleaned up his footwork and plays from a nice base.
cons: Always will have some bone head decisions where he doesn’t see a defender. Not the ideal QB size, a little small. Still needs to work on find the open man, sometimes gets locked on one receiver.
take: Rattler is a very talented QB, he was a 5 star that was thought of as a top 5 pick after his freshman year. He flashes that ability all the time but you also see why he wasn’t a top 5 pick in the last 2 years. He needs to continue to get better because the tools are there and he plays the game well, he just needs to take it to the next level.
RB Bucky Irving Oregon 77
size: *5'10 195, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 187 attempts 1,196 yards 11 TDs 1 Fum, 90.9 RUN 74.9 RECV 68 MFT
info: 21 years old.
pros: Back-to-back 100 yard seasons. 50 plus receptions in 2023, he can be used in the pass game. Young player that has 3 years of good experience. Has the juice to make quick cuts and accelerate in an instant. Good stop start, can make guys miss and run past them. Runs hard and can break tackles with effort.
cons: Not the prototypical size, sub 200. Not going to run through any tacklers, could be an issue on goal line runs.
take: Irving is an athletic back that has good speed and agility. He was also the lead back for Oregon back to back years showing that he could carry the ball 20 times a game and still be successful. He could turn into a dynamic RB in the NFL.
RB Ray Davis Kentucky 77
size: 5'8 220, 29 7/8 arms, 9 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 197 attempts 1,131 yards 14 TDs 1 Fum, 91.8 RUN 69.6 RECV 51 MFT
info: 24 years old.
pros: Back-to-back 1000 yard seasons. All around back, he has the speed power and agility you look for. Fights for extra yards, feet keep moving and falls forward.
cons: Transferred 3 times, not that bad but I don’t love it. Can get locked in on a man and run through them rather then take the open crease for a few more yards.
take: Davis has it all, he has no real weak points to his game. He should be able to start for an NFL team immediately and a productive NFL back.
RB Jonathon Brooks Texas 77
size: *6'0 207, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 187 attempts 1,135 yards 10 TDs 1 Fum, 91.9 RUN 75.2 RECV 63 MFT
info: 21 years old.
pros: Young back that had a 1000 yard season his first year starting. Quick and shifty back that can make guys miss 1v1. Good acceleration, once he sees space he is gone.
cons: Tore his ACL in his final season. Not a physical back, wont run through anyone.
take: Brooks finally broke out after sitting behind the best RB to come out in the last 10 years. Brooks has the juice to create explosive plays on any run with his speed and acceleration. If Brooks can bounce back from the ACL injury he will be a good NFL starter.
RB Jaylen Wright Tennessee 77
size: *5'11 210, 0 arms 0 hands
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: 21 years old.
pros: Young player that had a great true junior year. Solid all around back, no physical weaknesses. Great vision, seems to always get the most out of plays.
cons: One year of being a lead back. Doesn’t pop off the screen with athleticism or power.
take: Wright is an impressive young back, he’s got all the physical ability needed and the production and vision to go with it. He’s lacking the elite traits to go very high in the draft but he can be a good NFL back.
TE Ben Sinnott Kansas St 77

pros: Ideal body type good weight and height with big hands and long arms. Played over 3,000 snaps, very experienced. Strong in the run game, can move guys.
cons: Feet are a little slow that makes him hold too much. Plays out of control at times, still raw.
take: Jones has the measurables that you hope to find in a tackle and is relatively new to the game. He isn’t ready to play now but could end up being a very good NFL tackle.
OT Tyler Guyton Oklahoma 76
size: 6'7 328, 34 1/4 arms, 10 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

cons: Not refined at all, still raw. Plays with a high pad level. Feet are sloppy. Doesn’t use hands well in pass pro.

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

cons: Fumble issues, 7 in the last 2 years. Not a big or strong back, wont be running anyone over. Not the top end speed for his size.
take: Shipley is a very good and productive back. He has the vision and agility to make it in the NFL as a starting RB but he’s lacking the top end power and speed to put him as an elite RB.
TE JT Sanders Texas 76

pros: Great speed, can run away once he has separation. National champion and WR1 on Michigan. Solid ball skills, hands are good and can catch away from his body.
cons: Not a strong receiver, will get pushed off routes. Not much production after the catch, not a tackle breaker.
take: Wilson was a key part of Michigans championship run. He was a leader and their top receiver showing off his hands and his elite speed. He needs to work on getting separation and strength if he wants to make an impact in the NFL though.
WR Brenden Rice USC 76

info: 22 years old.
pros: Good off the ball, first step and punch are quick. Finishes blocks well. 3 years of experience in the SEC.

take: NA
OG Mason McCormick South Dakota St 75
size: 6'4 309, 33 7/8 arms, 10 hands.
test: 40 - 5.08 | 3 cone - 7.59 | shuttle - 4.45 | vert - 35.5 | broad - 9'9 | bench - NA.

OT Roger Rosengarten Washington 75
size: 6'5 311, 33 1/2 arms, 9 1/2 hands.
test: 40 - 4.92 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - 4.6 | vert - 30 | broad - 9'5 | bench - NA.
stat: 1,951 career snaps 15 pressures, 59.6 RBLK 80.8 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Solid size for the position. Solid athlete. Apart of a top tier offense in 2024.
cons: Gets caught leaning too much, can get off balance. Hand strikes aren’t powerful enough to stun rushers.
take: Rosengarten has the size and athleticism to play in the NFL, he needs to keep working on his technique to allow his a chance to start.
QB Jordan Travis Florida St 75
size: *6'1 212, 31 1/8 arms, 8 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 20 TD 2 INT 2,755 yards 63.7%, 84.0 PASS 72.5 RUN 19 BTT 8 TWP
info: 23 years old. Travis was a 3 star recruit out of Benjamin HS in FL where he didn’t receive many looks by power 5 teams so he went with Louisville. He didn’t play much, he backed up Jwan Pass and Malik Cunningham and transferred closer to home after the season. He was then the backup to James Blackman before taking over the starting role in 2020. He had a very good 2021-2022 season combining for 4,300 yards and 37 TDs. His final season started off great, he was inline to lead the undefeated Noles to the ACC championship before a bad ankle injury ended his season.
pros: Good ability to throw off platform and make plays. Good quickness, can evade rushers well and move in the pocket well. Good accuracy, some high level ball placement on tape. Good runner, he is a threat to run. Trusts his guys and throws with anticipation.
cons: Not the best follow through, doesn’t finish towards the throw. Arm strength isn’t the best, doesn’t have a great arm. Unsure about some of his throws translating to the NFL, doesn’t see the entire field at an elite level (NFL players would make him pay for some throws). Feet can get a little happy, needs to play with a better base in areas. Bad ankle injury to end his college career.
take: Travis is a very athletic playmaking QB who is a top tier college QB. He’s got some very good accuracy downfield and can throw with nice touch. His issues come with his size and arm strength, he doesn’t have the big arm you look for in high upside QBs. He should be given a chance at a starting QB spot in the NFL but you don’t want to throw all your eggs in his basket.
QB Michael Pratt Tulane 75
size: 6'2 216, 30 1/2 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 22 TD 5 INT 2,405 yards 65.4%, 75.5 PASS 71.4 RUN 19 BTT 14 TWP
info: 22 years old.
pros: Good size, well built with solid height. Good arm, can push the ball down field. Solid accuracy all over the field. Good base, strong feet in the pocket.
cons: Level of competition will be a big jump in the NFL. Not the best at finding the best matchup and getting to the open receiver.
take: Pratt is a well built QB with the arm to make it in the NFL. It will be a solid jump in skill level at the NFL but he could be an NFL starter in time.
RB Audric Estime Notre Dame 75
size: *5'11 227, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 209 attempts 1,341 yards 19 TDs 1 Fum, 94 RUN 72 RECV 64 MFT
info: 20 years old.
pros: Big strong back with good size. Great vision, follows blockers well and sets them up. Had an incredible year with a 94 grade. Breaks tackles in a lot of ways, hurdles trucks, jukes. Runs with a good pad level and patience.
cons: Not much of a receiving threat. Doesn’t have that elite home run speed. The quicks are middle of the road
take: Estime is a big strong back with great vision and plenty of production. He wont blow anyone away with his explosiveness but that’s not his game. He’s got plenty of speed and quickness to succeed but he’s more of a power back that plays the position well.
TE Jaheim Bell Florida St 75
size: 6'2 244, 32 7/8 arms, 9 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 39 receptions 503 yards 2 TDs, 75.2 RECV 64 RBLK 9.3% drop 50% contested
info: NA
pros: The most athletic "TE" in the draft. Weapon with the ball in his hands, great contact balance.
cons: Not a TE size, 6'2 is an outlier. Doesn't actually play TE.
take: Bell is an offensive weapon, he doesn't fit into a role well but an offense can design schemes around him.
TE Cade Stover Ohio St 75
size: *6'4 251, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 41 receptions 617 yards 2 TDs, 74 RECV 10.9% drop 40% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Big bodied receiver, impossible to find this kind of size. Really good breaks at the top of routes for someone his size. Good route physicality, gets hands off easy. Great range, catch radius is huge.
cons: Not a top of the line receiver, may want to move to TE. Not a good blocker at TE right now. Start stop ability is not good for a receiver.
take: Wilson is a big bodied receiver that should move to TE, I'd draft him in the second in that case. He could be a top of the line TE if he adds size and works at it. As for WR he should be a solid rotational receiver.
C Charles Turner LSU 74
size: 6'3 300, 33 3/4 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 1,758 career snaps 9 pressures, 65.1 RBLK 80.2 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Works hard in the run game, doesn't give up and runs his feet. Good athlete, moves well. Better anchor than size would indicate.

size: 6'4 315, 33 7/8 arms, 9 hands.

stat: 1,803 career snaps 31 pressures, 73.2 RBLK 56 PBLK
info: 24 years old.
pros: Team captain. Good size for a guard. Solid in the run game, can move people.
cons: Not much of a pass protecting tackle, better at guard. Not the best 1 on 1 pass pro player.
take: NA
OT Delmar Glaze Maryland 74
size: 6'4 323, 34 1/2 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,300 career snaps 14 pressures, 63.3 RBLK 83.6 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Started as a true freshman. Uses his hands very well, locks up defenders in pass pro. Solid strength to him, he’s a big tackle.
cons: Feet are a little slow. Base gets narrow at times. Just an ok run blocker.
take: Glaze is a solid pass blocker with solid size for the position. He can come in and play in the NFL right now if needed.
QB Joe Milton Tennessee 74
size: 6'5 236, 33 1/8 arms, 10 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 20 TD 5 INT 2,809 yards 64.7%, 71 PASS 78 RUN 12 BTT 8 TWP
info: 24 Years Old.
pros: Create a player build from madden, looks the part with his size athleticism and arm strength. Strongest arm I’ve ever seen, absolute cannon on him. Good runner, can move in space and has size to take on DBs. Pretty accurate, not missing open targets.
cons: 1 year starter at 24 years old, 5 years as a backup. Throws with no anticipation, relies on his arm strength. Not much touch on his throws, struggles when trying to lay a ball over the top of someone.
take: Milton is a freak, he is the closest thing to Josh Allen that has come out of college. He would be a top 10 pick if this was his true junior year, but if his anticipation and reading the field ability is sub par by year 6 in college it would be surprising if he figures it out in the NFL.
QB Devin Leary Kentucky 74
size: 6'1 215, 30 7/8 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 25 TD 12 INT 2,750 yards 56.1%, 69.8 PASS 66.8 RUN 17 BTT 23 TWP

RB Dillon Johnson Washington 74
size: *6'0 218, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 233 attempts 1,189 yards 16 TDs 2 Fum, 88.5 RUN 69.1 RECV 41 MFT
info: 23 years old.
pros: A lot of receiving experience at Miss St, over 170 career receptions. Toughed his way through a national championship game with various injuries. Good speed for the size, can run away in open field. Good burst, can get through the hole quick. Runs hard, willing to lower his pads and take what is there.
cons: No elite aspect of his game, nothing is top of the NFL tier. Not a patient back, wants to hit it fast.
take: Johnson is a very good RB that has shown it all on tape. He’s got all the measurables and stats you look for to make him a starting back in the NFL.
RB Cody Schrader Missouri 74
size: 5'8 207, 28 1/4 arms, 9 1/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 277 attempts 1,611 yards 14 TDs 1 Fum, 89.2 RUN 53.6 RECV 50 MFT
info: 24 years old.
pros: No nonsense runner, wants to get north and south and get whats blocked. Great production at over 1,600 yards. Former walk on that got the starting job and stood out in the SEC. Good build, solid size, and low center of gravity.
cons: Not the most athletic back that pops off the screen. Not adding much in the receiving game.
take: Schrader worked hard to get from Truman State to Missouri where he got the starting job and didn’t let it go. He’s a strong runner that’s missing the top end talent that gets you drafted high as a RB.
RB MarShawn Lloyd USC 74
size: 5'9 217, 30 7/8 arms, 8 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: 23 years old.
pros: Top 10 RB recruit. Very good athlete, Has great burst and good speed. Runs hard, doesn’t get tackled very easily.
cons: Fumbling issue, 8 fumbles in 290 carries. Not a powerful back, will struggle running inside the tackle box.
take: Lloyd is a very athletic back with top tier burst. He has his fumbling issues and he isn’t a prototypical north south runner but he should be in a running back rotation.
TE Dallin Holker Colorado St 74
size: 6'3 241, 33 arms, 10 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: 23 years old.
pros: Back to back years with 24+ MTF. Good production, 1000 yard senior season. Good athlete, has good speed and agility. Good with the ball in his hands, contact balance is great.
cons: Not the best receiver skills, plays in the slot and doesn’t have to deal with physicality.
take: Williams is a very good athlete, he is a top tier player with the ball in his hands. He hasn’t shown much with his releases, routes and high point ability. He seems like a gadget player right now but can develop to be very good.
WR Jalen Coker Holy Cross 74
size: 6'1 218, 32 1/2 arms, 9 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: NA.
pros: Good hands, catches almost everything and through contact. Good movement skills, has some nice breaks and set up on routes. WR1 experience being the guy. Was good with the ball in his hands at his size and athleticism.
cons: Played at Holy Cross, big talent jump to the NFL. Doesn’t have the top end speed to blow past people.
take: Coker has some really nice tape where he shows everything you would want. He has to get used to the talent jump in the NFL but if he can he will be a solid NFL WR.
WR Jamari Thrash Louisville 74
size: 6'0 185, 31 arms, 8 6/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 63 receptions 855 yards 6 TDs, 78.5 RECV 11.3% drop 15.8% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Good contact balance, can get out of a lot of tackles. Solid length, good catch radius. Solid production back to back 800+ years.
cons: Hands are a real concern, drop rate and contested catch rate are not good. Not a great athlete, he’s slow in and out of routes with little twitch.
take: NA.
WR Tez Walker North Carolina 74
size: 6'1 197, 32 3/4 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 41 receptions 699 yards 7 TDs, 68.3 RECV 6.8% drop 58.8% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Good speed, moves once he gets to full speed. Good size, big receiver with length. Good hands.
cons: Not a sudden athlete, only good linearly. Not a good separator, bad breaks and no subtle push offs. Not strong or shifty with the ball in his hands.
take: Walker is a deep threat only kind of receiver, he has good speed and can get open deep. The rest of his game isn’t great though, not much of a route runner or a YAC guy. He should get a shot and play on special teams.
WR Luke McCaffrey Rice 74
size: 6'2 202, 29 7/8 arms, 9 1/2 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 71 receptions 992 yards 13 TDs, 82.6 RECV 4.1% drop 60.7% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Has some good genetics. Used to play QB so has an understanding for the WR position from that. Very good at the catch point, good hands and focus.
cons: Not a good athlete, just athletic enough to be in the NFL. Quickness and RAC aren’t his game.
take: McCaffrey isn’t the level of athlete as his brother, but they may have the same receiving level. He’s a big bodied receiver that catches the ball well and runs solid routes.
OG Trevor Keegan Michigan 73
size: 6'5 308, 32 5/8 arms, 10 hands.
test: 40 - 5.24 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 30.5 | broad - 8'11 | bench - NA.
stat: 2,253 career snaps 11 pressures, 63.9 RBLK 80.7 PBLK
info: 23 years old
pros: Looks like the baddest man on the field. Top recruit coming out of Illinois. Solid pass pro, good sets to cut off rush lanes. National champion.
cons: Plays too high, a little too stiff. Not much power to his game, wont move anyone off the ball.
take: Keegan is a solid guard, he gets the job done and has for his entire career. He doesn’t have the plus strength or athleticism to be an all pro guard but he could start in the NFL.
OT Javon Foster Missouri 73
size: 6'5 309, 35 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,939 career snaps 13 pressures, 86.5 RBLK 80.9 PBLK
info: NA
pros: 3 year starter with very good grades in all of them. Good length, has the necessary size with plus length. Good aggression in run blocking.
cons: Plays high and bends at the waist. Plays off balance too often, doesn’t look in control.
take: Foster is a big athletic lineman that has a lot of experience. He needs to clean up his footwork and positioning to play more smooth in order to be a good tackle. He is a bit of a project but he has the tools to be a starter.
OT Brandon Coleman TCU 73
size: 6'4 313, 34 7/8 arms, 10 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - 4.99 | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 34 | broad - 9'6 | bench - NA.

QB Carter Bradley South Alabama 73
size: 6'3 220, 31 1/2 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 19 TD 7 INT 2,650 yards 67.4%, 61.8 PASS 73.8 RUN 10 BTT 12 TWP
info: NA.
pros: Has a great arm, serious zip is on the ball. Good feet in the pocket, moves well and keeps a strong base. Gets through the progressions fast. Solid pocket evasion skills.
cons: Touch passes are far and few between, needs to work on that rather than always throwing fastballs. Not much of a rusher, just an ok athlete. Short accuracy is bad because of the velocity. Accuracy is inconsistent.
take: Bradley has a cannon on him, he has a very strong arm and loves to use it. He also works the pocket pretty well and can get through his reads. He’s lacking the accuracy and athleticism to be drafted as a teams QB 1, but with development he can carve out a good career.
RB Daijun Edwards Georgia 73
size: 5'9 202, 29 1/2 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 164 attempts 879 yards 13 TDs 1 Fum, 80.5 RUN 69.2 RECV 38 MFT
info: NA
pros: Lead back for the last 2 years at Georgia. Electric athlete, super shifty. Fast, his acceleration is next level and can capture edges with it. Runs very hard, need to get your pads on him to take him down.
cons: Smaller back, can get eaten up by LBs and DLs. Not a short yardage back, wont push a pile or stay up running up the middle. Like to bounce it a little too much.
take: Edwards is an explosive RB, he has the game changing speed and athleticism. He may not be the big strong goal line back but if a team wants a home run threat he is the guy.
RB Jase McClellan Alabama 73
size: *5'11 212, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 181 attempts 888 yards 8 TDs 0 Fum, 84.5 RUN 56.9 RECV 49 MFT
info: 22 Years Old.
pros: Good build, has the prototypical size. Good recruit that went to Alabama. Very good speed, can be a home run threat down the sideline. Runs hard, wont go down very easily. Solid power to his game.
cons: Only one year as the lead back. Not very sudden, not going to shake anyone out of there shoes. Doesn’t have top tier vision and patience.
take: McClellan is a big strong fast back that was RB1 at Alabama. He’s got all the tools you look for but is just missing that next level vision and shake to take his game to the next level. He can become a starting RB in the NFL but probably wont be a top of the league back.
RB Braelon Allen Wisconsin 73
size: *6'2 245, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: 20 years old.
pros: 3 years of nearly or more than 1000 yards. Not going to be arm tackled, too strong for that. Good vision, sees the blocks well and picks the correct hole. Strong legs, hard to bring down and can push piles.
cons: 9 fumbles in his career. Not a good athlete, not going to be scary in open field. Can dance too much instead of putting head down and going.
take: Allen is a old school workhorse RB. He’s got the vision and power that translates to every scheme, but he doesn’t offer much more than down hill running. He's an ok athlete which will probably prevent him from being a top RB.
RB Kimani Vidal Troy 73
size: 5'8 215, 29 7/8 arms 9 3/8 hands
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 295 attempts 1,661 yards 14 TDs 2 Fum, 93.7 RUSH 62.5 RECV 92 MTF
info: 22 years old.
pros: Forced 92 missed tackles, an unreal number. Good stocky build, runs with a low center of gravity. Good vision and feel for blocks, makes the right decision more times than not.
cons: Not a sudden player, doesn’t make people whiff. Not a top level athlete, not scary in the open field.
take: Vidal is a solid back, he dominated the bad competition and held his own against Power 5 defenders. He is lacking the high level athleticism but he has everything else. He runs similar to Javonte Williams so if a team wants a back like him Vidal is your guy.
RB Emani Bailey TCU 73
size: 5'7 202, 29 5/8 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 223 attempts 1,211 yards 8 TDs 2 Fum, 88.2 RUN 65.1 RECV 68 MFT
info: 22 years old. Plays like SaRodorick Thompson.
pros: Ran for 1,200 yards and an 88 rush grade his one year starting. He has serious juice, can change direction violently. Runs very hard, not easy to get down 1 on 1.
cons: Sat behind Demarcado and Keondre Miller in 2022. The speed isn’t top tier like his change of direction. Vision can be questionable at times.
take: Bailey is a spark plug as a RB, he can come in and add juice to a running back room. He runs violently, changing direction and running his feet through contact. Bailey can be a great backup RB that comes in to change the pace of the backfield.
RB Tyrone Tracy Purdue 73
size: 5'11 209, 31 5/8 arms 8 7/8 hands
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 114 attempts 714 yards 8 TDs 0 Fum, 90.5 RUSH 72 RECV 46 MTF
info: Gatorade PoY in Indiana
pros: Played WR so is versitile out of the back field. Has a good feel for running the ball and making guys miss.
cons: Played for 6 years in college with only 1 productive year. Not a powerful back, wont run through any backers. Needs to work on reading keys and vision still.
take: Tracy is a raw RB but he has the natural ability to make people miss. He has a little Rashad White in him, a solid receiving threat and a natural ability to run the ball.
TE Brevyn Spann-Ford Minnesota 73
size: 6'7 267, 33 1/4 arms, 10 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 47 receptions 604 yards 1 TDs, 70.6 RECV 9.6% drop 81.8% contested

stat: 59 receptions 1,062 yards 8 TDs, 85 RECV 1.7% drop 66.7% contested
info: NA
pros: Very productive with a 1,000 yard senior season. Very quick, has great change of direction skills. Good all around athlete. Good hands.
cons: Very small, looks tiny on tape. Wont be a physical receiver, can’t deal with strong DBs. Doesn’t do many NFL type receiver skills, a lot of open slot routes.
take: Washington is a very athletic receiver with great hands. He is just small which will limit his ability to be a top end receiver.
WR Jacob Cowing Arizona 73
size: 5'8 165, 29 1/4 arms, 9 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: 23 years old.
pros: 3 staright very productive seasons, combined for over 3k yards. Good movement skills, can run nice crisp routes and get separation early. Solid athlete, NFL speed and agility.
cons: Smaller receiver, doesn’t have the prototypical size. Ran mostly from the slot in college. Hands aren’t top tier, too many drops in his career. Not great when he has the ball, doesn’t break many tackles.
take: Cowing was a very productive receiver at Arizona, he was there captain and number one guy. He moves well for the position which shows in his routes and separation ability. His playmaking skills are lacking though, his hands and RAC are just ok so he wont be a 1 in the NFL.
WR Jha'Quan Jackson Tulane 73
size: 5'9 190, 30 7/8 arms, 8 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 26 receptions 439 yards 4 TDs, 73 RECV 10.3% drop 37.5% contested

pros: Really good athlete, moves fast on the field. Good breaks, can change direction and not lose speed. Great when he gets the ball in his hands.
cons: Never had over 600 yards in a year, No stats that pop off the screen. Smaller receiver, not a tall or strong WR.
take: Jackson is an electric athlete, his movement skills are top notch. He lacks the hands and receiver skills to become a great WR though.

OT Ladarius Henderson Michigan 72
size: 6'4 309, 34 7/8 arms, 10 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,441 career snaps 31 pressures, 58 RBLK 44.7 PBLK
info: 22 Years old
pros: Solid power in the run game, can cave the line down. National champion that has went through the gauntlet of the best pass rushers in NCAA.
cons: Bad senior year with 30+ pressures allowed. Slow feet, can get beat with speed.
take: Henderson doesn’t have the best measurables or PFF grades but he played some solid football. He has a lot of experience with top tier pass rushers that will be high NFL draft picks. He can be a solid swing tackle in the NFL and if he hits his potential a solid starter.
OT Sataoa Laumea Utah 72
size: 6'4 319, 33 arms, 9 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - 26 | broad - 8'8 | bench - 26.

stat: 25 TD 11 INT 3,386 yards 66%, 74.7 PASS 70.6 RUN 25 BTT 20 TWP
info: 24 years old
pros: Had a year with a 90 PFF grade. Solid accuracy, very good in the underneath game and can push the ball with accuracy. Has mobility to extend plays.
cons: Small QB, sub 6 foot. Gets caught staring at one receiver too much, not any eye manipulation. Athletically and arm talent isn’t elite to make up for size.
take: Taulia has the better arm out of him and his brother, but the anticipation isn’t at the elite level Tua’s is. Taulia has a solid arm and is a solid athlete who throws with accuracy and anticipation but he doesn’t have the calling card to make him elite. He could stick around as a good backup and even run an offense as a starter if needed.
RB George Holani Boise St 72

info: 24 years old. Went to Syracuse before Louisville.
pros: Great speed, break away ability and hits the hole hard. Solid Shake, can change directions well without losing speed.
cons: Took until he was 24 to really break out. Vision is questionable, doesn’t read IZ well. Smaller back that looks for contact, doesn’t play to his strength.
take: Jordan is an explosive back, he has very good speed but his vision is questionable.  If he hits in the league he can do some serious damage and create explosive plays.
RB Rasheen Ali Marshall 72

info: 23 years old.
pros: Very good pff grade, 89.9 offensive grade in 2023. Good athlete, can be a part of the run game and extend plays. Throws the ball in good spots down the sideline, puts back shoulder throws on the money.
cons: Had to transfer from Ole Miss, couldn’t win the job. Smaller QB at 6 foot flat. Arm is just ok, not a special arm talent.
take: NA
RB Frank Gore Southern Miss 71
size: 5'7 199, 29 arms, 8 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: 22 years old. Son of Frank Gore.
pros: Back to back years of 90+ PFF rush grades and over 2,400 yards combined. Makes a lot of people miss, had a year of 83 MTF. Good athlete, can change direction very easily to get to open space. Played on a horrible team and still played well.
cons: Small back, not going to run through contact well. Played a lower level of competition.
take: Gore isn’t like his dad, he doesn’t have much power to his game but he gets it done a different way. He’s got the start and stop ability to go with great change of direction. He should be able to contribute to an NFL RB room.
RB Michael Wiley Arizona 71
size: 5'10 209, 30 1/8 arms, 9 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

cons: Played against a very low level of competition. Not physically elite, doesn’t have plus anything.
take: Laube was a productive solid back for New Hampshire. He has good vision and some good ability but it is a massive jump in level of competition.
TE AJ Barner Michigan 71

cons: Never produced over 600 yards in a season. Can struggle when guys get hands on him. Not much extra added when he has the ball in his hands.
take: Rosemy-Jacksaint is a solid college receiver, he is talented with good hands. He doesn’t to anything at a very high level though, he will end up being a rotational NFL receiver.
WR Andrew Armstrong Arkansas 71
size: *6'4 200, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

stat: 2,196 career snaps 16 pressures, 60.2 RBLK 69.8 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Top tier recruit, number 1 guard in the class. Solid size and athleticism for a center. Experienced starter in the big 12.
cons: Never had a great PFF grade, consistently average. Gets thrown off balance way too much. Not much strength to his game, doesn’t move people.
take: Raym had a disappointing college career from being the top recruit from Oklahoma. He looks the part but really struggles with balance and power.
OG Layden Robinson Texas A&M 70
size: 6'3 302, 34 arms, 10 1/2 hands.

OT Ethan Driskell Marshall 70
size: 6'8 312, 35 1/8 arms, 10 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,115 career snaps 20 pressures, 62.5 RBLK 74.9 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Moves pretty well for a 6’8 lineman. Pass pro is solid, can mirror pretty well.
cons: A little too tall where he loses leverage. Didn’t play the best competition every week at Marshall.
take: Driskell is a long tackle that has the movement skills to play in the NFL. He doesn’t have much power to his game so he will most likely be a backup swing tackle.
QB Sam Hartman Notre Dame 70
size: 6’1 210, 30 7/8 arms, 9 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 24 TD 8 INT 2,696 yards 62.3%, 79.8 PASS 57.3 RUN 25 BTT 14 TWP
info: 24 years old. Hartmans story has been well documented as he appeared on the Show QB1 playing at Oceanside in SC. He was a 3 star recruit and committed to play at wake forest where he backed up John Wofford for his first couple of years. By his 4th year he was the full time starter and by the end of his 5th year he was the best QB Wake has ever had. He threw for 11,859 yards over his 5 years with 99 TDs and back to back All Conference seasons.
pros: Very experienced and has a high pedigree. A lot of RPO experience, was asked to make a lot of decisions. Throws a good touch pass over the middle and seam. Goes through progressions fast to scan the entire field.
cons: Going to be an old rookie, 25 by week 1. Not the best athlete, wont be able to scare people with the run and isn’t a real scramble threat. Arm isn’t special, not many wow throws with plus accuracy and velocity.
take: Hartman has a lot of experience with 1,907 career attempts and 15,670 yards. He's seen it all and it shows by the way he can get through progressions and run an offense. He doesn’t have that next level arm or athleticism though, which will put a ceiling on his career where he needs a good supporting cast to be a plus starter.
QB Jack Plummer Louisville 70
size: 6'4 220, 32 1/4 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 21 TD 12 INT 3,198 yards 64%, 73.9 PASS 59.1 RUN 19 BTT 16 TWP
info: 24 years old.
pros: Good ideal size, looks like the prototype. Throws the ball with good touch, very catchable ball. Can move in the pocket and extend, not a statue.
cons: Not a great athlete, will run but wont be a big threat. Arm strength is only ok, dont see much velocity.
take: NA
RB Isaiah Davis South Dakota St 70
size: 6'0 220, 31 1/8 arms, 10 1/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 236 attempts 1,578 yards 18 TDs 1 Fum, 94.6 RUN 65.3 RECV 78 MFT
info: NA
pros: 3,000 yards in the last 2 years and 4 straight 90+ Rush grades. 150 MTF in the last two years, not an easy back to bring down. Career 6.7 YPC, dominated the FCS level. Good size, big strong back. Good patience and vision, very reliable runner.
cons: Played in the FCS, level of competition will be a big jump. Speed is lacking, not going to run away from anyone.
take: Davis is a solid back that has dominated the FCS level for 4 years. He has the vision, patience, and production to get him into the league. He’s just lacking the top end athleticism to be a plus NFL starter.
RB Jacory Croskey-Merritt New Mexico 70
size: *5'11 204, 0 arms 0 hands
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 188 attempts 1,191 yards 17 TDs 2 Fum, 92.8 RUSH 75.5 RECV 59 MTF
info: NA
pros: Had a breakout 2023, with a 90+ pff grade and over 1000 yards. Runs very hard, fights for each yard. Good athlete with good speed and agility. Jump cuts are sudden and explosive.
cons: Didn’t produce at alabama state and had to pump his numbers up the last 2 games at New Mexico. Can dance a little too much in the backfield.
take: Croskey-Merritt is an extremely talented back that if he played 5 years like he did his last year he would be a 2nd round pick. The question is why was he underachieving until last year. If a team picks him up he could be a home run pick.
RB Jaden Shirden Monmouth 70

stat: 220 attempts 1,460 yards 10 TDs 1 Fum, 83.1 RUN 61.7 RECV 39 MFT
info: NA
pros: 1 fumble in 500 attempts. Back to back 1,400+ years with an average of 7.4 YPC. Solid athlete, has good agility a solid speed.
cons: Played against lower level competition. Not a strong runner, wont put the pads down and drive forward.
take: Shirden is an athletic productive back that dominated the FCS level. The jump to the NFL will be big for him but he should get a shot at it.
WR Smoke Harris Louisiana Tech 70
size: *5'7 183, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: 24 years old.
pros: Great with the ball in his hands, nearly 100 career missed tackles forced. Good returner.
cons: Too small to be a great receiver. Only good for gadget plays.
take: Harris is a great return man and good in the screen game. He wont be a great receiver.
OT Jeremy Flax Kentucky 69
size: 6'5 360, 33 arms, 9 1/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 1,341 career snaps 12 pressures, 53.5 RBLK 75.4 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Great size, can’t move him and he can reset the LoS. When he has his hands on you its over.
cons: Doesn’t move well enough, needs to lose weight. Not a good run blocker because he is too slow.
take: Flax is a big tackle that needs to lose weight and work on his speed to be an NFL starter. He can be a solid backup and a good goal line TE.
OT Garret Greenfield South Dakota St 69
size: *6'7 320, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 3,263 career snaps 9 pressures, 56.6 RBLK 82.6 PBLK
info: NA

QB Garrett Shrader Syracuse 69
size: *6'3 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 13 TD 6 INT 1,693 yards 63.1%, 69.6 PASS 77.6 RUN 9 BTT 13 TWP
info: 23 years old. Shrader was a 4 star recruit and a top 10 dual threat QB in 2019 where he mistakenly chose Mississippi State over Syracuse. As a true freshman he played a little bit getting 3 SEC starts and 203 dropbacks. He threw for 1,168 yards with 8 TD and 5 INT before deciding to enter the transfer portal to go to the red hot Syracuse Orange to be there starter. He struggled a bit his first season at cuse with 12 TWP and only 9 BTT but he turned it around in 2022. He had a very good 2022 season throwing for 2,650 yards and 17 TDs with a 64% completion percentage and adding value on the ground. Short and intermediate accuracy is pretty good, good ball placement.
pros: Very good runner, have to account for him scrambling and he’s a threat in the run game. Good feet, solid base the entire time and throws from a good base. Tough, willing to take hits.
cons: Not a very pleasing throwing motion, doesn’t look smooth. Looks to scramble too fast, not patient with his eyes down the field. Inconsistent accuracy, too many balls that don’t let receivers run with it. Arm strength is average at best. Doesn’t process and see the field at a high level, too many missed open WRs. A lot of RB swings and screen passes in the offense, not a very translatable offense.
take: Schrader plays hard and wills his offense forward at times, he’ got the ability to take over the offense. Unfortunately he’s no the best at executing the offense, he misses a lot of open receivers and doesn’t play with great anticipation. He could be a good 3rd string QB.
QB Kedon Slovis BYU 69
size: 6'2 214, 31 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 12 TD 6 INT 1,717 yards 57.5%, 68.7 PASS 66 RUN 12 BTT 12 TWP
info: Coming out of Desert Hill in Arizona Slovis committed to USC to backup JT Daniels. After Daniels got hurt in the season opener Slovis became one of five true freshman USC quarterbacks to start a game for the trojans. He had a great true freshman year and was the PAC 12 Freshman of the year as well as made freshman All-American. He played solid his sophomore year earning an 80 PFF grade while throwing 17 TDs and 7 INTs.
pros: Moves in the pocket well. Feet are always in a good position. Shown ability to go through full field reads. Finds the checkdown well. Throws against the blitz well. Solid accuracy underneath.
cons: Doesn’t have a good arm. Threw a lot of outs that wouldn’t work in the NFL. Puts the ball in harm’s way too much.
take: Slovis has shown the ability to go through multiple reads and get the ball out of his hand. The only issue is his arm strength doesn’t compare to top quarterbacks in the NFL which limits his ceiling. Reminds me a little of Josh Rosen.
RB Kendall Milton Georgia 69
size: *6'1 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 121 attempts 790 yards 14 TDs 0 Fum, 89.6 RUN 55.9 RECV 30 MFT
info: 22 years old.
pros: Strong back with good size, can push a pile.
cons: 11 career receptions, not a threat. Not much of an athlete, speed is ok but he has no agility.
take: Milton has the size and strength but being a good RB in the league may be a stretch. He plays a little high with no shake to his game.
TE Trey Knox South Carolina 69
size: 6'3 239, 33 3/4 arms, 9 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

take: NA
WR Ainias Smith Texas A&M 69
size: 5'9 191, 29 1/4 arms, 8 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 53 receptions 795 yards 2 TDs, 79.3 RECV 1.9% drop 55.6% contested
info: 
pros: Only one drop in 2023, good hands. Really good with the ball in his hands, can even take snaps at RB. Good return man, electric in open field. Change of direction is very good, kills defenders angles.
cons: Not much of a receiver, not going to create separation. Not a tall receiver, smaller catch frame. Slot only, wont play on the outside in the NFL.
take: Smith is an electric player with the ball in his hands. He isn’t much of a receiver, he’s more of an athlete.
WR Ryan Flournoy Southeast Missouri 69
size: 6'1 200, 31 1/4 arms, 10 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 59 receptions 825 yards 7 TDs, 80.6 RECV 1.7% drop 35% contested
info: 24 years old.
pros: Good with the ball in his hands, 24 missed tackles forced. Solid size and athlete, NFL type body.
cons: Level of competition was low. Needs a lot of work on his releases and routes.
take: Flournoy has the ability to be an NFL receiver but he’s a little far off from that. He needs to develop before he can contribute to an NFL team.
WR Tayvion Robinson Kentucky 69
size: 5'10 196, 31 3/8 arms, 9 1/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 41 receptions 552 yards 4 TDs, 73.9 RECV 12.8% drop 80% contested
info: NA.
pros: Produced well every year from 2019-2023. Solid at adjusting to off target passes.
cons: Transfered out of VT. Never had over 600 yards in a season. Not a high level athlete, speed and acceleration are not special.
take: NA
QB Frank Harris UTSA 68
size: *6'0 205, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 18 TD 8 INT 2,501 yards 64.3%, 76.8 PASS 77.3 RUN 12 BTT 10 TWP
info: 24 Years old.
pros: 3 very good years at UTSA grading over 80 in all 3. Solid runner, can scramble and be dangerous in open field. Accurate, puts the ball on the money especially in the quick game.
cons: Smaller QB, under 6 foot. Lefty, don’t like the look. Bad feet in the pocket, loses his base. Arm strength isn’t NFL average.
take: Harris had a great college career and deserves a shot in training camp. He’s accurate and a good athlete, but his size and arm strength will be tough to overcome.
QB Austin Reed Western Kentucky 68
size: 6'1 223, 30 1/8 arms, 9 3/4 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: 24 years old.
pros: Had a great 2022 season with a PFF grade of 79.7 and throwing for 4,744 yards. NFL level arm, has the arm strength to make it in the NFL. Solid movement in the pocket.
cons: Not an accurate passer, way too many missed short throws. Didn’t run a real offense, screens and plays off screens for the majority of his passes.
take: NA
QB Spencer Sanders Ole Miss 68
size: 6'1 211, 30 5/8 arms, 9 1/2 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 3 TD 0 INT 278 yards 65.5%, 86.5 PASS 66.8 RUN 3 BTT 0 TWP
info: 24 years old.
pros: A lot of experience, starting as a true freshman in 2019. Good athlete, can be a part of the run game.
cons: Transferred to be a backup. Bad throwing motion. Feet are inconsistent.
take: NA
RB Miyan Williams Ohio St 68
size: *5'9 226, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 142 attempts 825 yards 14 TDs 0 Fum, 91.1 RUN 52.3 RECV 48 MFT
info: 22 years old.
pros: Has never fumbled in his career. Strong runner, lower center of gravity and strong legs.
cons: Lack of total production. Season ending injury in 2023. Not a receiving threat. Not a top of the line athlete, quicks and speed are ok
take: Williams is a classic power back, not much flash to his game. He was never the lead guy for OSU which doesn’t translate well to being a starting RB. He could carve out a RB 2/3 role in the NFL.
RB Jarveon Howard Alcorn St 68
size: *5'10 200, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 250 carries 1,239 yards 12 TD 77.1 RUN.
info: NA.
pros: 68 MTF in 2022. Got better every year and dominated the first year he got a shot. Runs hard with very good contact balance. Good burst, he explodes into contact and through the line.
cons: Couldn’t get on the field at Syracuse. Not a top tier athlete, he doesn’t have the great agility or top speed. Questionable vision, doesn’t look to set up blockers and give them time to set up.
take: Howard was a top back in the SWAC this year, getting 1,239 yards and 68 MTF. He’s a tackle breaker that runs angry and with good contact balance. He’s not the level of athlete to be drafted high or the vision to be an RB one, but he has a shot of making the roster as the 3rd back.
TE Tip Reiman Illinois 68
size: 6'4 273, 33 1/8 arms, 10 3/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 19 receptions 203 yards 3 TDs, 61.3 RECV 54.6 RBLK 0% drop 25% contested
info: NA
pros: Big TE that serves as a 2nd blocking TE.
cons: Not an athlete, blocker only.
take: NA

stat: 35 receptions 638 yards 6 TDs, 59.4 RECV 10.3% drop 36.4% contested
info: 23 years old
pros: Good length at the position. Good stopping ability at his height.
cons: 5 years and never played at a very high level. Plays at Tennessee, tough to translate to the NFL.
take: Keyton will have to make an adjustment from the weird Tennessee offense if he wants to play in the NFL. He’s got solid size and is an NFL athlete but it just hasn’t panned out for him yet.
WR Lideatrick Griffin Mississippi St 68
size: *5'10 180, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 50 receptions 659 yards 4 TDs, 72.4 RECV 9.1% drop 60% contested
info: 23 years old.
pros: Has some impressive speed and deep ball tracking on his tape. Good enough athlete with plus agility and speed. Good ability with the ball in his hands to get extra yards.
cons: Ran from mostly the slot only. Doesn’t seem to give all his efforts on routes. Don’t see any plus routes, just runs to a spot.
take: Griffin is a slot only kind of receiver. He needs a lot of work to play in the NFL but the skill set is there with his athleticism.
WR Jordan Whittington Texas 68
size: *6'1 204, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: NA.
pros: Solid athlete that went to VT.
cons: Not a big receiver, shorter and thin.  Doesn’t run great routes, just trys to win with speed.
take: NA
QB Brennan Armstrong Virginia 67
size: *6'2 212, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 11 TD 7 INT 1,783 yards 60.6%, 72.5 PASS 71.2 RUN  10 BTT 7 TWP
info: 24 years old. Armstrong was born in Shelby Ohio where he was a dominate QB for his HS and was a 3 star prospect after leading his team to a 13-1 record. He garnered interest from many big 10 schools even committing to Iowa State before eventually flipping his commitment to Virginia where he enrolled in the spring. He was the backup behind one of Virginias best QB’s Bryce Perkins his first 2 years where he only played in garbage time. In his redshirt sophomore year he was named the starter as well as team captain and hit the ground running, passing for 2,114 yards and running for 677. He received a 90.3 PFF grade for that year but only led the team to a 5-5 record. His redshirt junior year he took a big step in the passing game and became more efficient. He threw for 4,429 yards with a 64.7 completion percentage and a 31 TDs with 10 INTs. He improved his grade to a 91.8 and his passing grade to a 90.3 but still went 500 going 6-6. The worst case scenario happened his final year though, he got a new coach in Tony Elliot and the offense fell off a cliff as well as Armstrongs play. His grade tanked to below a 60 and threw for 2000 less yards and only 7 TDs with 12 INTs.
pros: Solid arm strength, can make a throw to anywhere on the field. Good runner, is a threat with his legs but doesn’t rely on them heavily. Has shown good anticipation throws, splitting zones on the break of a receiver. Trust his receivers to make plays, not afraid to put it on the back shoulder or let his receivers box out defenders. Good accuracy to all levels, has solid touch on the deep ball and on intermediate routes.
cons: He’s a lefty and it always looks weird which doesn’t matter. Had 9 fumbles and 21 turnover worthy plays his best year, he has to cut down on those and protect the ball. Feet need a lot of work, doesn’t like to throw off of a good platform. A lot of weird movements in the pocket, has the ball in one hand and pumps until his guy is open. Would like to see more zone manipulation so safeties can’t get a beat on it. Needs to throw with slightly better anticipation consistently, lets defenders make up ground too often. Makes terrible decisions with the ball for no reason, just can’t make some of these throws in the NFL
take: Armstrong is a back yard football player. There needs to be more reps where you see him stand in the pocket and throw with solid timing. He has a good arm and is a good athlete but he makes some of the worst decisions with the ball that I’ve seen so that has to be cleaned up to play in the NFL.
QB Emory Jones Cincinnati 67
size: *6'3 212, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 18 TD 10 INT 2,219 yards 61.2%, 66.5 PASS 69.1 RUN 7 BTT 13 TWP
info: 24 years old, birthday during the draft.
pros: Good build, solid size and good athlete. Nice arm with a smooth release. Plus runner, used a lot in the QB run game.
cons: Doesn’t read the defense very well and throw with anticipation. Never played at a high level on 3 different teams. Doesn’t throw receivers to open space well.
take: Jones may look the part of a QB but he’s never played at a high level. It’s been an issue on 3 separate teams where his accuracy and decision making hurts his team and is likely a backup if he makes it in the league.
RB CBo Flemister Pitt 67
