OG Trevor Keegan Michigan 73
size: 6'5 308, 32 5/8 arms, 10 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,253 career snaps 11 pressures, 63.9 RBLK 80.7 PBLK
info: 23 years old
pros: Looks like the baddest man on the field. Top recruit coming out of Illinois. Solid pass pro, good sets to cut off rush lanes. National champion.
cons: Plays too high, a little too stiff. Not much power to his game, wont move anyone off the ball.
take: Keegan is a solid guard, he gets the job done and has for his entire career. He doesn’t have the plus strength or athleticism to be an all pro guard but he could start in the NFL.

cons: Athleticism doesn’t pop off the screen, not the top tier athlete.
take: Beebe is a very good guard that showed his top tier run blocking for 3 straight years. Hes a powerful guard that was meant to be in a gap scheme heavy run offense.

take: Haynes made some money at the senior bowl, he showed that he can hold up to bull rushers at his size. He is good in both the run and pass game and he should be a starter day 1 in the NFL.
