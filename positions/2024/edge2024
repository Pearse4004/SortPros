stat: 55 pressures 11 sacks 29 tackles, 69.8 RDEF 61.5 TACK 89.3 PRSH
info: 21 years old.

EDGE Jared Verse Florida St 85
size: 6'4 254, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - 4.58 | 3 cone - 7.31 | shuttle - 4.44 | vert - 35 | broad - 10'7 | bench - 31.
stat: 62 pressures 11 sacks 25 tackles, 65.3 RDEF 63.3 TACK 90.8 PRSH
info: 23 years old. Verse was somehow a 0 star recruit in 2019 where he ended up going from Bloomsburg PA to Albany to dominate the lower level of competition. After 2 years and 50+ pressures Verse entered the transfer portal to go to Florida State. He recorded 9 sacks in 12 games and was named 1st team all ACC and the Florida State defensive MVP.
pros: Great get off, he get on tackles so fast that it can catch them by surprise. Violent hands, will pack a punch to a tackle and easily bull rush into them. Has good hand combat skills, swipes arms well to get OL off balance and pass them. Very high motor, plays with his hair on fire and needs to get to the QB. Great power when he gets into OL, walks them back. Has 3 plus pass rush moves, a bull rush, a hand swipe and win with speed and a cross face rip. Can throw around OL in the run game.
cons: Struggles when in a stand up position with leverage, he doesn’t stay low and set an edge with good leverage. Weak counter rushes, he rarely uses them but when he does they are a little slow. Doesn’t have elite balance where he can bend and stay upright well. On the smaller side of power rushers, not the longest or sturdiest rusher. Misses too many tackles, doesn’t break down well enough and plays a little out of control.
take: Verse is a dynamic edge rusher that is super explosive. He can get into the pads of OL and move them back with ease which helps set up his other 2 rushes. He also has strong hands in the run game which will help him set an edge. He just lacks the agility and balance to be a top tier pass rusher, he misses too many tackles and his bend and change of direction aren’t strong points of his game.
