size: 6'4 315, 31 7/8 arms, 9 7/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 2,196 career snaps 16 pressures, 60.2 RBLK 69.8 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Top tier recruit, number 1 guard in the class. Solid size and athleticism for a center. Experienced starter in the big 12.
cons: Never had a great PFF grade, consistently average. Gets thrown off balance way too much. Not much strength to his game, doesnâ€™t move people.
take: Raym had a disappointing college career from being the top recruit from Oklahoma. He looks the part but really struggles with balance and power.
C Jackson Powers-Johnson Oregon 77
size: 6'3 334, 31 1/8 arms, 9 5/8 hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 1,355 career snaps 1 pressures, 85.2 RBLK 90.6 PBLK
info: NA
pros: Young center that has played well in the power 5 3 straight years. Good strength, can toss players once he has his hands on them. Good athlete for 334 pounds. Can handle nose guards.
cons: One year full time starter. Needs to develop more with technique not to get tossed around. Handling speed is a question. Short arms.
take: Powers-Johnson has the potential to be a very good center. All he is missing is length, but he has the chance to be a top center in the NFL.
