EDGE Will Anderson Alabama 89
info: Anderson was a 5-star recruit with offers to every major program coming out of Dutchtown HA in GA. He stepped onto campus ready to play earning a starting spot immediately and was a Freshman All-American. He put up 60 pressures with 8 sacks that year and graded out as a 79.1 as a true freshman in the SEC. He one upped himself his true sophomore year by leading the nation in pressures with 81 and 15 sacks grading out at an 89.9 and leading the Bama defense to the national championship game. He was a 1st team All-American and won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for his outstanding season.
pros: Excellent run defender, packs a punch on initial impact. Powerful hands, can stun blockers and rip through like nothing. High level athlete, can get off the ball unbelievably well and can time up snaps well. High motor player, good ant working in stunts and cleaning up in the run game.
cons: Not a very refined pass rusher, he doesn’t have many moves to beat tackles. His length is sub-par for a top level edge, he doesn’t stick out on the field just looking at him.
take: Anderson is a superb athlete with the strength and athleticism to dominate tackles with speed and power. He’s a great run defender as well so he can do it all. If he keeps working on new moves he could be an elite pass rusher in the NFL.

QB Emory Jones Arizona St

info: Jones was always a talented QB, he was even offered by Mississippi State in 2015 as a Softmore in highschool and not too much longer the rest of the offers came in. He received an offer from nearly all the schools in the east coast and he had his pick and decided to go to the QB factory of Ohio State. He decommitted from the Buckeyes and decided to stay closer to his hometown of LaGrange GA and commited to Florida. At Florida he was always a highly thought of backup but couldn't play over QBs such as Kyle Trask and Felipe Franks both of which ended up in the NFL. He got the starting job the year after Kyle Pitts, Kadarious Toney and other stars left and he did a decent job there. He threw for 2,729 yards and 19 TDs with 13 INTs. He transfered to Arizona State to join Herm Edwards and avoid the QB competition with Anthony Richardson and was the opening day starter for the Sun Devils. Fans were calling for a change though, halfway through the season Arizona State switched QBs and went with Trenton Bourguet who didn't do much better. Although his starting record isn't very good with a lot of losses he has played better than the record has shown.



QB James Blackman Arkansas St

info: Blackman was a high 3 star recruit coming out of Belle Glade FL as a 6'5 165 pound project. He commited to Florida State to sit and learn behind returning starter Deondre Francois. That plan didn't happen though, Francois went down with an injury in 2017 when the seminols were 2-5 and Blackman came in and as a true freshman led them to 6-6 throwing for 58%, 2229 yards and 19 TDs with 11 INTs. He returned to the bench in 2018 but in the one game he got to play against NC State he made the most of it. He received an 88 grade with 420 Yards and 4 TDs. That earned him the staring spot in 2019 where he was named captain but it was a disapointing season where he had more tournover worthy plays than big time throws. He ws the opening starter in 2020 before a young Joran Travis took the job and didn't let it go resulting in Blackman transfering to Arkansas State. He played well at Arkanasas State where he had a combined 30 BTT and only 11 TWP.



EDGE Brenton Cox Florida

info: Cox was a 5 star big time recruit comming out of Stockbridge GA where he could go wherever he wanted in college.

As a true freshman at georgia he made good contributions with a 74 PFF grade. He transfered fro Georgia to Florida after seeing all the talent on the edges there and began to play for the Gators in 2020 and had his best season with 48 pressures and a 80 PFF grade. He was good for the Gators but a huge red flag happened halfway through the 2022 season where he was dismissed from the team for punching a Georgia RB and other undisclosed issues.
