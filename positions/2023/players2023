QB Bryce Young Alabama 94
info: Young was a top 25 recruit of all time coming out of the power house HS Mater Dei where he lit up the competition leading to an offer from nearly ever power 5 team. Young Committed to Bama where he served as the backup to Mac Jones. After Mac left and was drafted in the first round Young picked up where he left off and dominated leading the Crimson Tide to an SEC championship vs the wildly talented Georgia team. He was awarded the Heisman trophy for the dominating season where he threw for 4,860 yards and 47 TDs and 7 INTs.
pros: Has the pedigree of a top level player, 5 star QB of Alabama and exceeded expectations for him. Keeps the ball out of harms way, only 2% TWP rate and 12 INTs in 931 attempts as well as 1 TWP when not pressured. Nothing looks much better than when he throws it on time and in rhythm, it’s poetry in motion. Has incredible arm talent, can make accurate throws on the run using not technique. Can throw at many different arm angles to get around defenders. Has enough athleticism to make plays on the run. Short quick release that is dangerous in the quick game. Many full field reads on his tape where he finds the 3rd receiver open. Moves well in the pocket, slips away from the defenders and finds open spaces in the pocket. He’s him, when he has the ball late and you need a score he gets it. Solid accuracy everywhere on the field.
cons: He’s very small, 5’10 sub 200 would make him a one of a kind QB at that size. Drifts way too much in the pocket, too many plays where he scrambles backwards that wont end well in the NFL. Would love to see more plays that he sets his feet and delivers a good ball with a follow through, too many just arm throws. Under pressure he never makes a good strong throw where he takes the contact and throws it normal. Doesn’t have a cannon that you want out of a top pick, not truly impressive arm strength.
take: Young is like Zach Wilson if Wilson had the pedigree and makeup of a top pick. Young has great arm talent and the intangibles that you look for in franchise QB. Sometimes you draft a guy for talent other times you draft him because he plays at a higher level than every one else, that’s exactly why you draft Young. He can be a franchise guy and lead a team to wins nearly all by himself.
DL Jalen Carter Georgia 93
info: Carter was a 5 star recruit coming out of Apopka FL where he was compared to former Apopka resident Warren Sapp. The star DL was between some Florida and SEC schools and decided to go join the power house Georgia. As a true freshman he played in all 10 games and even caught a TD from Stetson against Tennessee. In 2021 he broke out in a loaded DL with Jordan Davis and Devante Wyatt forming probably the best interior DL in CFB history. He was 2nd team All SEC and helped the Dogs win the national championship over Alabama with 6 pressures in that game. He continued to show how dominate he was in 2022, continuing to improve in the run game and dominate guards in the pass game. He was named an All American and helped Georgia win another national championship.
pros: True junior that was a 5 star coming out of high school and has improved every year. Arguably the most dominated defender on a defense that produced 5 1st round picks. Back to back 89+ pass rush grades with a 24% win rate on true pass sets. Back to back national champion, he has had much success in his career. Great power, he walked Florida’s guard back easily. Plays with great leverage off the ball, he’s so quick and low off the ball he gets the upper hand on OL. Uses hand swipes well in the pass game and extends in the run game to shed blockers. Strong upper body, can toss OL off balance easily.
cons: He’s not the biggest DL, could struggle to hold up in the run game if quickness doesn’t work. Has not played over 400 snaps in a year. Probably not the best 2 gap players, way better at shooting gaps. Likes his go to outside move on the guard with a swim too much maybe, not many counters off of that.
take: Carter was the most dominate player in college football last year. He really doesn’t have weaknesses, the only things are he didn’t play a bunch of snaps and he probably needs to add more pass rush moves. He’s physically on another level with his explosiveness and it showed every play he was out there. He will be an All Pro at some point and the best player on his DL.
EDGE Will Anderson Alabama 91
info: Anderson was a 5-star recruit with offers to every major program coming out of Dutchtown HA in GA. He stepped onto campus ready to play earning a starting spot immediately and was a Freshman All-American. He put up 60 pressures with 8 sacks that year and graded out as a 79.1 as a true freshman in the SEC. He one upped himself his true sophomore year by leading the nation in pressures with 81 and 15 sacks grading out at an 89.9 and leading the Bama defense to the national championship game. He was a 1st team All-American and won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for his outstanding season. He came back his junior year and picked up where he left off. He’s was a stud racking up 14 sacks and being named an All American again.
pros: Excellent run defender, packs a punch on initial impact. Powerful hands, can stun blockers and rip through like nothing. High level athlete, can get off the ball unbelievably well and can time up snaps well. High motor player, good ant working in stunts and cleaning up in the run game.
cons: His length is sub-par for a top level edge, he doesn’t stick out on the field just looking at him. Overall size isn’t what you would want at 6’4 243.
take: Anderson is a superb athlete with the strength and athleticism to dominate tackles with speed and power. He’s a great run defender as well so he can do it all, he even lined up a 3 tech in a bear front. If he was a tad longer he would be the first pick no doubt but he’s an amazing player that wont get out of the top 5.
QB Anthony Richardson Florida 91
info: Richardson was a 4 star recruit out of Gainesville FL and decided to commit to his hometown Gators.  After Penn State and Georgia offered him he opened his recruitment back up but stayed with Florida. He barely played his true freshman year behind Trask and Emory Jones but by his second year he got some reps after Jones disappointed. He came into the 2022 season as the starter for the Gators where he flashed while throwing for 2,500 yards and 17 TDs with 9 INTs while only throwing for 53%.
pros: Doesn’t take many sacks, under a 9.2 pressure to sack rate. Has elite arm strength and can put serious velocity on a ball when needed. Has arm talent to make off platform throws down the field. Has great size and athleticism for the Position, at 6’4 240 and the running skills to be a low-end RB he is a playmaker at QB. Moves around the pocket and avoids defenders very well.
cons: Takes forever to throw the ball, 3.18 average time to throw. Only completed 53% of his passes. Has some funky mechanics when throwing, his feet need a lot of work to settle down and be on platform. Not accurate now, has issues putting the ball where he wants it and it needs to be. Not helped by the garbage gators offense but never made great reads and focused more on the one target he had in mind. Not great in a west coast scheme, he’s not a game manager that will execute an offense well now.
take: Richardson is the closest thing to Josh Allen in a while and if he succeeds it will be a similar path. He has serious accuracy concerns which can be attributed to bad technique that is fixable, if he puts the work in he has the ability to be the next great QB in the NFL.
OT Peter Skoronski Northwestern 89
info: Skoronski was a solid 4 star recruit coming out of Park Ridge IL and was heavily recruited by Notre Dame but committed to Northwestern as an interior OL. He followed in his grandfather’s footsteps though, he played OT for the Packers and is in the Green Bay Packers hall of fame so he started as a true freshman at LT. He immediately played well earning a true Freshman All-American spot and a 2nd team all big 10. His sophomore year he continued his domination and was named to the first team all big 10 while grading at 83.8 and only allowing 97.4% allowed pressure rate. In 2022 his final year he came back with one goal in mind, dominate. That’s exactly what he did, he gave up on 6 total pressures all year with a 99.2% allowed pressure rate which is the best in the nation. He was named 2nd team All American and was the best pass protector in college football.
pros: One of the best college pass protectors, only gave up 6 total pressures on 474 pass blocking snaps. Amazing in pass pro, everything about it is nearly perfect. Feet are great, always balanced and always keeps his feet moving in the run game. Great hands, the placement is nearly perfect every time and his hands in pass pro are awesome. Good at picking up stunts and blitzes, keeps his eyes up and understands defensive stunts.
cons: Not the longest limbed tackle, gets pushed away by longer edge players. Doesn't have that next level athleticism, pop in run game is average and not a great mover in space.
take: Skoronski is one of the best pass protectors to come out of college recently, he does it with great technique and solid athleticism and strength. He's reminds me a lot of his former teammate Rashawn Slater, a great OL that lacks the power and length to be a top 5 pick. He's a great offensive lineman though who could immediately step in and start for any team in the NFL.
QB CJ Stroud Ohio St 89
info: Stroud was a solid recruit coming out of Rancho Cucamonga CA where he was getting some looks before the Elite 11. After dominating at the Elite 11 his stock skyrocketed up to a high 4 star recruit and committed to Ohio State to back up 1st round pick Justin Fields. He didn't play in 2020 but in 2021 and 2022 he lead the Buckeyes to the CFP as well as being named a Heisman trophy finalist. In the OSU offense he put up amazing stats throwing to 1st round picks everywhere. Over the 2 years he threw for 7,760 yards 81 TDs and 12 INTs with a 92.2 and 84.1 PFF grade.
pros: Picked apart the middle of the field all year. Has the speed to be a running threat although he doesn’t use it. People around him say he has impressive character and is a great guy. Can really push the ball down the field, strong arm and good technique. Great down the field accuracy, puts the ball in very good spots. Works at a very high level in the pocket, looks like teaching tape on how to play QB.
cons: The Ohio State offense really helped out, open 1st round pick receivers everywhere. Awful under pressure, had a 34 PFF grade which is a massive drop from normal. Non rushing threat, he has broken one tackle in his entire career. Almost nothing to like out of structure, never makes a great play like that.
take: Stroud is very very reminiscent of the OSU QBs of the past. He looks great because all the open receivers and talented receivers. There’s no out of structure plays to fall back on but him in the pocket operating the OSU offense looks fantastic. He’s got the size, arm strength and production to be a great NFL QB but we need to see if it will translate.
WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba Ohio St 89
info: Smith-Njigba was a 5 star coming out of Rockwall HS in TX where he put up absurd numbers and leaving the state of Texas to join Olave and Wilson in Ohio at OSU. in 2020 his true freshman season he played sparingly thanks to 3 top 15 picks but Jameson Williams left for Alabama the next year and he stepped into the slot role. His 2021 season was great, he caught 95 balls for 1,600 yards and 9 TDs with a 91.7 pff grade. Nothing was more impressive than what he did when he was the lone target in their bowl game where he put up 336 yards and 3 TDs. He let down OSU his senior year after he got hurt and only played 40 total snaps in 2022 and missed the CFP.
pros: Didn't have many contested catch snaps but he went 9/10 when he got them. Really good and natural hands, makes tough catches look simple. Really good out of breaks, sets up defenders well and accelerates out of the break. Great body control, can twist and readjust to any ball to make the catch.
cons: Missed so many games in 2022, he only had one season of actually playing. Played slot only with stars on the outside, a very easy situation. Doesn't have the best speed, wont run away from anyone. Never really had to deal with press.
take: Smith-Njigba would be a top 10 pick easily if he repeated hos 2021 performance, but he missed his senior season. He's got the Keenan Allen skill of getting open and making plays on the ball but is just lacking that top end speed. The ability to be a great number 1 receiver is there, but with the lack of pysical tools it is more of a risk than you would like.
CB Christian Gonzalez Oregon 88
info: 4 INTS 6 PBU 45 tackles 83 TACK 81.4 COV.
pros: True junior that got better every year he played. 4 INTs in 2022 with 6 pass breakups, good ball production. Great size at 6’2 201. Long and fluid athlete that is great on the boundary covering go routes and stop routes at the sticks. Can flip his hips well and accelerate to full speed fast. Solid tackler, gets wide and low to wrap up ball carriers in open space. Good press coverage snaps, shows a variety of different techniques.
cons: Not the most twitched up corner, can get beat by quick moves and breaks. Not an overly physical corner, he won’t be throwing his body around in the box to stop run plays any time soon. Can get beat on double moves by looking into the backfield too much.
take: Gonazalez has it all, he’s a long corner with excellent movement skills and the ability to play press, zone and any coverage you ask of him. He showed the ability to play the ball in 2022 by getting 4 INTs and didn’t do much wrong all year. If he became a more physically imposing player he would be right there with Carter and Anderson, but he’s a great CB that should translate well to the league.
QB Will Levis Kentucky 88
info: Levis was an impressive recruit coming out of Xavier HS in Connecticut. He was the number 2 player coming out of Connecticut with a 4.0 GPA and offers to nearly every ACC and MAC school. He chose to go to the Big 10 and played for Penn State in 2018. He redshirted his first season and only got 2 starts over the next 2 years against Rutgers and Iowa. He decided to transfer because he didn’t want to sit behind Sean Clifford so he went to the SEC and chose Kentucky. He had a very good season both passing and rushing being one of Kentucky’s team captains. He put up 2,827 yards on a 66 completion percentage and 24 TDs 13 INTs along with 516 rushing yards. His Senior year was a bit of a disappointment, his stats dropped off a bit from his junior year but he went from a 90 to 68 PFF grade.
pros: Well built QB, 6’3 232 pounds, he clearly puts in the work in the weight room. Not a cookie cutter QB, has a funny personality behind him (see his bio and tik toks). Good runner, adds to the offenses run game. Has the NFL arm and accuracy, he’s not great but he’s NFL caliber. Can make some really nice throws on the run, good athlete that can play out of structure. Solid arm strength, ball comes off the hand easy and can launch it with little effort. Great at hitting a stationary target, can get screens out and run a quick hitting offense.
cons: Will be 24 by the time he starts a game in the NFL. Half of his production are just screen passes and designed sweeps by the offense. Inconsistent with finding open receivers over the middle, looks to the perimeter a lot and can get stuck on one player. Struggles with pressure, passing grade drops to 51 under pressure and 65 when blitzed (2021). Doesn’t make many of the wow throws down the field and over the top of defenses. When he leaves the pocket, he will leave to the wrong side or just not execute a scramble well. Not very accurate, throws it high to open receivers and doesn’t throw on platform.
take: Levis has everything physically you are looking for in an NFL QB, he’s 6’3 230 of very good weight and has the arm to play in the NFL. He is a good runner who can make the throws need from him, but he’s not a fully developed QB by any means. He was protected a little by the Kentucky offense and needs to be more consistent with his ball placement and decision making.
WR Jordan Addison USC 88
info: Addison was a slightly built 4 star recruit out of Frederick MD where he decided to stay closer to home and enroll at Pitt with future 1st round pick Kenny Pickett. He made an immediate impact by catching 60 balls for 662 yards and was named a True Freshman All American. His Sophomore season blew that out of the water though, he caught 100 balls for 1,593 yards a 17 TDs which was enough to win him the Biletnikoff award. That season made him a hot commodity in the transfer portal where he teamed up with Caleb Williams to lead USC to a comeback season for the Trojans. He caught 59 balls for 875 yards and 8 TDs and was named 1st team All-PAC 12.
pros: Production alone is great, 3,130 career yards and a Biletnikoff award. Good speed, can burn DBs down the field. Fixed drop concerns in 2022, only dropped 2 balls and made a lot of nice catches. Quick in his routes, with the ball and off the line. Good balance, can get knocked around and stay on his feet. Good ball skills down the field, can track the ball well.
cons: Slim frame, at 180 pounds he can get pushed around with physicality and mess up timing. Would have liked to see more production in 2022 with Caleb Williams.
take: Addison is pretty close to Garrett Wilson coming out, both are undersized but so quick and good at the position it didn’t derail them. He can clearly produce while being the teams number 1 and I expect that to continue in the NFL.
CB Devon Witherspoon Illinois 87
info: 3 INTS 14 PBU 32 tackles 72.9 TACK 92.5 COV.
pros: A true shut down corner, 206 yards on 35% completion percentage and 0 TDs. 3 INTs and 14 PBUs, good ball production. Top graded CB and an All American. First play of the year he killed a WR screen. Very twitched up, explosive and aggressive athlete. He has that dawg in him, he wants to hit and wants to win every rep.
cons: Had the one great year, didn’t show out until 2022. 6 foot 180, on the skinnier side of corners. Didn’t play the greatest receivers, wasn’t truly challenged. No much press man to man where he is locking up a WR.
take: Witherspoon is a CB you want on your team. He’s a firery competitor that will attack in the run and screen game and can lock down in the pass game. He’s on the smaller side and isn’t the smoothest press man corner but he will be a good NFL player.
EDGE Myles Murphy Clemson 86
info: Murphy was a 5 star recruit out of Marietta GA where he had offers from everywhere. After a dominated HS career he joined DJ and Bresee enrolling at Clemson to join the power house up and coming program. He showed out his freshman year getting 5 sacks and being named a freshman All American. He followed his amazing freshman season up with back to back All ACC selections and getting 15 sacks over those 2 years.
pros: The perfect edge build, an athletic 6’5 275. Graded 79 and above all 3 years of college, never even played average. 5 star recruit true junior, he has potential. Great burst off the line, can get up field in a hurry. Shows good bend, can rip and get to the edge with his athleticism. Has good power to his game, devastating long arm and can walk guys back with his length and strength.
cons: His grade dropped every year instead of showing improvement. ND LT ate his lunch, his hand fighting is under developed and will get beat by good technique every time. Can get beat when it's time to make the play because of lack of agility, needs to be a finisher.
take: Murphy is a lot like Walker from last year, he’s the prototypical edge player but is lacking development. Murphy has all the athletic traits you look for, the size, length, strength and athleticism to be a top DE in the league. He just needs to get in his bag and learn pass rush moves and the little things about playing DE and he will be an All Pro player.
DL Calijah Kancey Pitt 85
info: 47 pressures 8 sacks 19 tackles 80.9 RDEF 92.4 PRSH.
pros: Great athlete for the position, so quick off of the ball. Played all 3 years at a high level. ACC player of the year and an all American. Can swim and sidestep then bend around guards like nothing, they can’t handle his speed. Actually held up to double teams really well. Great leverage, gets under OL and can bull them back.
cons: Wildly undersized at 6 foot 280. If a good OL gets hands on the rep is over, he’s small.
take: Kancey is the closest thing to Aaron Donald I’ve seen, he’s just a weaker and smaller Donald. That’s not a slight though, he’s still plenty strong and consistently abused OL. As long as a team doesn’t ask him to sit and occupy a gap or 2 gap he’s going to be an impact player.
S Brian Branch Alabama 85
info: 74 tackles 2 INT 90.7 RDEF 91.8 TACK 86.4 COV.
pros: True junior that played all 3 years for Alabama. Only missed 4 tackles in his career. Got better every year and had a 89.5 grade in 2022. Great burst, when he see’s something he goes from 0 to 100 real quick. Great IQ, see’s the game well and is versatile.
cons: On the slimmer side for a safety at under 200 pounds. Didn’t play much deep safety, mostly a box safety. Needs to add strength, strong ball carriers can gain extra yards on him.
take: Branch is a very very good football player that will fit on any team. He’s a smart player that can play in the box at a high level and is very aggressive tackling. He will be an NFL starter immediately and could become a top safety in the league.
EDGE Nolan Smith Georgia 84
info: Smith was another 5 star recruit (Top 20 all time) coming out of IMG academy where he was recruited by everyone and went to the best defense in CFB Georgia. As a freshman he was a co winner of the Defensive newcomer of the year for Georgia after a 5 sack season. He didn’t play much in the 2020 season but came back in 2021 and graded at a 85 with 7 sacks during the national championship run for the Bulldogs. He came back his senior year to be a leader of that defense but he tore his pec 8 games
pros: Former 5 star recruit that played well in college, good potential. Majoring in Math, not just a typical football player. Amazing athlete, OL can’t keep up with his speed and agility. Swipes hands well and can bend the edge, easily wins to the outside. Surprising power and can explode into OL and drive them back.
cons: On the smaller side at 6’3 235, not the size of a typical edge. Between injuries and playing time he wasn’t an every down player. Not sure about him setting an edge in the run game, more of a disruptive gap shooter.
take: If smith had prototypical size he would be a top 5 pick. His top recruiting ranking was no joke, he’s a freak athletically, he’s got the speed, bend and agility to make plays in the backfield. He doesn’t have the strength and length a traditional edge has, but he can still pass rush at a high level. He has a shot to be an all pro type player if he can hold up to NFL physicality.
RB Bijan Robinson Texas 84
info: Robinson was a HS All American where he won the Ed Doherty award (Top Arizona HS player) two years in a row. He had 114 TDs in high school which is a state record and those accolades lead to a high 5 star label with offers from many top programs. He chose Texas over all of them and immediately made an impact running for 700 yards with 8.1 YPC. His second year he took over the full time starting spot and ran for 1,127 yards with a 91.1 PFF run grade and 79 MTF. If that wasn't good enough he came back better than ever, He ran 1,575 yards 18 TDs with 4.17 yards after contact and 1004 MTF. All of that lead to a 96 run grade and a Doak walker award.
pros: Unreal short area quickness, could actually make a defender miss in a phone booth. Very good athlete, can run away in the open field and hit home runs. Good size and strength, can muscle his way through a defender when he needs to and always go forward. Great contact balance, very strong lower half that allows him to eat contact and keep going. Has great instincts when he has the ball, knows where defenders are and the best way to make them miss. Solid hands, shown the ability to make non trivial catches.
cons: Doesn’t have the best vision for and ability to set defenders up to be blocked. Only ok in pass pro, nothing special. Dances a little too much that can cause 4 yard gains to be 0.
take: Robinson is one of the most talented backs ever to enter the draft. There aren’t many flaws in his game, if anything he needs to learn how to slow down and be more decisive. He will immediately become a teams star RB and play very well from day 1 in the NFL
CB Cam Smith South Carolina 83
info: 1 INT 6 PBU 20 tackles 64.8 TACK 64.5 COV.
pros: 2021 had an 88.4 PFF grade. Great IQ and instincts, see’s plays develop and can blow up plays. Shifty corner that can cut and accelerate on a dime. Good ball skill, made some great plays on the ball over his career.
cons: Had a down year in 2022 compared to 2021. In 2022 moved to slot and didn’t perform as well as he did at outside. Not a big or very fast athlete, he’s pretty slim and not a 4.4 guy.
take: Smith’s comp is a slightly worse Devon Witherspoon. He’s on the lean side but he plays hard and see’s the game well. He doesn’t look like your prototypical CB but he’s a quick athlete that plays the position at a high level.
EDGE Tyree Wilson Texas Tech 83
info: Wilson was a 3 star recruit out of Henderson TX where he was his districts defensive MVP. He initially chose Texas A&M where he played his freshman year before transferring to Texas Tech. He played well over the next 3 years developing into the teams best DL and capped his senior year off with 8 sacks and All American honors.
pros: Great size and length, at 6’6 280 with 35+ inch arms he is a great edge build. Steady improvement every year. Don’t try to block him with a TE, he will dominate him physically. Has a nice long arm and an inside swim.
cons: Never was a star pass rusher, maxing out at 8 sacks. Not a great athlete, not much explosion off the ball or natural power. Can’t win around the edge, the speed and bend isn’t there.
take: Wilson is an impressive looking edge defender that plays with good strength and effort. He’s missing the athleticism you look for in a edge defender, he wont threaten the edge on NFL tackles and will have to really lean on his length. He should be able to start immediately but his ceiling isn’t as high as you would like.
OT Anton Harrison Oklahoma 83
info: 1,866 career snaps 72.6 RBLK 83.3 PBLK 9 pressure.
pros: True junior that played every year and started the last 2. Always graded well in pass pro in a pass heavy offense. Solid size and strength, 6’5 310. Very Smooth mover, looks very balanced as solid in pass pro. Great at mirroring DE’s always keeps a good relationship between him  the defender and the QB. Holds his own in the run game, gives great effort.
cons: Would like to see him gain some strength to really start moving people in the run game and anchor better. Played in a unique spread offense where the box was never loaded. Needs to clean up hand placement, still needs to develop that aspect.
take: Harrison is a young good pass protector that impressed all year. He has the issues that young tackles have, he needs more strength and to continue to work on technique but he has shown plenty of good play throughout his career.
CB Kelee Ringo Georgia 82
info: 2 INT 5 PBU 40 tackles 69.4 TACK 70.3 COV.
pros: Physical specimen, he has the most impressive physical traits in the corner back group. Great speed to pursue plays. Good reps where he runs the route for the defenders. Played on 2 national championship teams and played well each year.
cons: Not the best change of direction, shifty receivers can gain separation too easily. Doesn’t use his hands enough at the line, likes to mirror WRs but that’s not his game.
take: Ringo is the player you create in madden at CB. He’ a big strong fast boundary corner that played solid in the SEC and won 2 national championships. Like many big corners he struggle sticking to shiftier WRs because he’s a little tight but he’s a good corner that can play immediately.
OT Dawand Jones Ohio St 82
info: 1,723 career snaps 85 RBLK grade 79.5 PBLK grade 5 pressures.
pros: 2 year starter where he graded above 82 both times. Massive tackle at 6’8 360, dwarfs many defenders he sees. 0 sacks and 5 pressure his senior year. Solid run blocking grades, 90 and 85. Great punch timing and placements. Has long arms to keep pass rushers away from him. Can move people in the run game with power.
cons: Slow feet that makes it harder for him to mirror speed rushers. Can get off balance because of his limited athleticism.
take: Jones is ready to step into tackle and play day 1, he’s got the frame that makes OL coaches happy. He’s super long and has solid strength, if he could just get quicker feet he would be an All Pro player at some point in his career.
TE Dalton Kincaid Utah 82
info: 70 receptions 890 yards 8 TDs.
pros: 91.7 PFF receiving grade in 2022, top TE in the country. 1.6% drop percentage, great hands. Good athlete that can use his speed and strength after the catch. Great ball skills, very natural and strong hands. Good routes, knows how to sit in zone and create separation.
cons: More of a slot TE than an inline blocking TE, he can get tossed around while blocking. Was a 5th year player and still not a good blocker.
take: Kincaid is an interesting evaluation; he didn’t start playing football until 2017 but is a natural at it. He has the ability to be one of the best receiving TE’s in the league with his solid athleticism and great hands. He’s not your old school TE that can block inline but if he can work on that and continue to develop, he will be a top 5 TE in the NFL.
EDGE Lukas Van-Ness Iowa 81
info: 46 pressures 9 sacks 15 tackles 80.9 RDEF 74.3 PRSH.
pros: Solid size, 6’5 269, he looks the part. 33.9 win rate on true pass sets. Very good hands, placement in the run game is good and uses them in pass rush moves well. Has a solid bull rush in his game. Can rush from both the edge and interior. Great motor, a student of the game.
cons: Not a great athlete, wont blow by tackles with speed, has to win with a good move. For some unknown reason he never started, was just a heavily used sub.
take: Van Ness doesn’t have many weaknesses, you would like to see him be a better athlete and play more but that’s it. He’s a strong solid pass rusher that can overpower tackles and use his hands well in both the run and pass game. He’s got some serious potential considering he wasn’t a starter and played 2 years at Iowa so he may end up being the steal of the draft.
OT Paris Johnson Ohio St 81
info: Johnson was the top OT in the class of 2020 along side Georgias Broderick Washington. Johnson stayed local going from his HS in Cincinnati to Ohio State where he served as a backup his entire freshman season. His Sophomore season he got the starting job and was very impressive as Ohio States RG grading out at a 79 PFF grade. He became the LT for the Buckeyes in his final season as he improved his grade to an 83.1 and only allowed 2 sacks and 12 Hurries.
pros: Always graded well for PFF never being below a 79. Improved every year while moving positions. True junior who was a 5 star recruit and the top of his class. Prototypical OT size at 6’6 315. Very good athlete, moves very fluid for a big man and can play in space. Good zone blocker, can reach guys very well with his athleticism.
cons: One year of starting at Tackle where he will be in the NFL. Technique needs work, likes to shoot hands wide and allow guys into his chest. Not a powerful lineman, not moving people in a gap scheme and his anchor is average. Plays off balance too often, feet stop too often and he is left lunging. Loses to the inside far too often, needs to play half the man better.
take: Johnson is a highly thought of prospect but he needs some serious work. He’s the type of player you draw up to play the position but he is lacking the technique and play strength as of now. He has the tools to be a top LT in the league but he’s a far way from it currently.
TE Michael Mayer Notre Dame 81
info: Mayer was the number 2 TE recruit and the Gatorade Kentucky player of the year. He had all the schools offering him so he decided to go to the TE factory ND. He immediately flashed as a top TE along side Tommy Tremble. His first year he caught 42 balls for 450 yards and solidified himself as NDs next great TE. He backed it up the next 2 years catching over 65 balls and 800 yards each year with a PFF grade of 92.5 in 2022 where he was named an All American.
pros: True junior at 6’4 250 with a 90+ PFF grade and an All American. Great run blocker, very willing and strong at the point of attack. Strong hands, can catch a ball while being hit by an LB.
cons: Not the modern day 4.4 blazing fast TE that can play WR as well.
take: Mayer will be at least a solid starting TE for an NFL team that is his floor. He’s a big strong TE that has great hands and an ability to get open. If he can just get a little more athleticism he can be a top TE in the NFL.
DL Keion White Georgia Tech 80
info: 41 pressures 7 sacks 33 tackles 78.7 RDEF 75.6 PRSH.
pros: Solid size, at 6’5 280 he a big edge that can handle the edge.  Played well for GT, he was a physical player with a high motor. Good power for an edge, has a bull rush and strong hands. Could play interior and be a solid rusher from there. Freaky athlete at his size, is very strong and surprisingly athletic.
cons: Already 24 years old. A bit of a tweener, he’s not a good enough athlete to win on the edge. Wasn’t dominate even at 24 and 280, he has a bull but its not special. Not long enough to win on the edge with his long arm.
take: White is all potential at this point, he is raw in the pass game and only had one year of power 5 play. He is a physical freak at 280 with the strength to play interior and just enough to play edge. He isn’t a starter day 1 and needs a lot of work but he could end up being a very good DL.
OT Broderick Jones Georgia 80
info: Jones was the 1b to Paris Johnsons 1a in the 2020 recruiting class. Similarly, to Johnson, Jones decided to stay local and go to his home state Georgia Bulldogs. He didn’t play much his freshman year but in the championship run in 2021 he got significant playing time getting 438 snaps. He came in to 2022 as the starting LT playing every game and only letting up 9 pressures on 470 pass blocks.
pros: True junior and a high 5 star recruit. Solid power and athleticism, has plays where he over powers LBs and runs to block in space. Wants to finish his blocks, has the dog in him to end the play with the defender on the ground. Reps where he wins the hand fighting game.
cons: 6’4 and not the longest tackle, routinely has issues with longer defenders getting in his pads. Stops his feet too often allowing a secondary rush to beat him. Off balance too often, lunges and loses leverage.
take: Jones is another talented 5 star recruit where you wish he could have played better. He needs to become more of a technician if he wants to win at the NFL level. If he learns how to play with more balance and keep defenders off his chest he can be a great tackle.
WR Quentin Johnston TCU 80
info: Johnston was a high 4 star recruit coming out of Temple HS in TX where he originally committed to Texas. He ultimately decided to go to TCU as one of the highest WR recruits they ever got. His first season there he showed off some impressive deep ball skills racking up 487 yards and 22.1 YPC. In 2021 as a true sophomore he showed his big play ability again with spectacular catches and 604 receiving yards. He really broke out in 2022 where he got 1,067 receiving yards and was named 1st team big 12 and lead TCU to the national championship game.
pros: Great size at 6’4 215 and is 21 as a true junior. He is a walking big play, averaged 18.8 YPC over his career. Great with the ball in his hands, he broke 19 tackles in 2022. Physical freak, can fly at his size, runs past CBs easily. Strong with the ball, can stick a foot in the ground and shake off defenders.
cons: May be the next Kevin White, game may not translate. For a guy his size he only was at a 40% career contested catch rate. Had a 10% drop rate which for a top receiver is a little high. Not impressive out of breaks, will not be creating separation at the stem. Agility and twitch are not apart of his game, he moves a little slow when trying to make people miss
take: null
C John Michael-Schmitz Minnesota 79
info: 2,495 career snaps 92.4 RBLK 81 PBLK 8 pressures.
pros: Remington award winner and the top graded center at 92.3.4 seasons of over 400 snaps with over 80 PFF grades. Good center size at 6’4 320, not a typical undersized lineman. Solid strength for a center, can anchor well against bull rushes. Great zone blocker, runs his feet well and gives high effort. Good IQ in pass pro and uses his hands well.
cons: Older prospect, going to be 24 in the NFL. Plays high leaving him vulnerable to be out leveraged. Would like to see more power in the run game by vertically moving people off the ball.
take: Michael Schmitz is ready to step in and play center in the NFL, he was fairly dominate in college which should allow him to be a serviceable starting center. The upside isn’t really there, he isn’t a special athlete but he’s solid and that’s whats needed in the center position.
CB Emmanuel Forbes Mississippi St 79
info: 6 INT 7 PBU 42 tackles 67.9 TACK 89.3 COV.
pros: Allowed 3 completions in man coverage, that’s also how many INTs he had. 14 INTs in 3 years and is a true junior. Great ball skills, locates the ball and makes plays on it. Long frame and loves to be physical, will get hands on and try to be physical. Has some great high IQ plays that can turn the tide in a game.
cons: Lean frame, another 6 foot 180 pound corner. Again he’s a twig. Not going to be a good run support player, needs to add strength. He’s a gambler, can get beat by losing his assignment.
take: Forbes looks like Devonta Smith with the lack of size on him. He’s not a very strong corner so he will struggle with that in the NFL but he plays hard and covered SEC receivers really well. He is a boom or bust corner though, he’s a gambler like Marcus Peters. If he’s right more than he is wrong he could have a great NFL career.
DL Bryan Bresee Clemson 79
info: Breese was the number 1 overall recruit playing at Damascus HS in MD. He had 35 sacks in HS with 134 career tackles and capped off his career with a state championship. After being named the Gatorade player of the year he committed to Clemson over every other power 5 school where he would play as a true freshman. He racked up 4 sacks and was named the ACC defensive freshman of the year and was an All ACC player. He only played in 4 games in 2021 after sufferring an injury to his knee and missed the rest of the season. He came back in 2022 and looked a lot like his freshman year and delt with a lot of adversity. He had a kidney inffection as well as dealt with the trauma of his sister having brain cancer. He battled through the season and finished the season with 3 sacks and an ACC championship.
pros: Former number 1 recruit over Jalen Carter that played well as a true freshman. 6’5 300 and a great athlete, has the physical tools. Good athlete for his size and can be a problem on stunts and free rushes. Shows plays where he flashes good pass rush moves.
cons: Under 1,000 career snaps, missed most of 2021. A lot of stunts from the Clemson D that isn’t how he will play much in the NFL. Shorter arms than you would like, can let OL into his pads and dictate the block. Pad level is too high, plays upright. He has been hurt every season, injuries are a concern. Not your every down solid player way too flashy.
take: Bresee had a somewhat disappointing career, he flashed as a freshman but didn’t really build on that. He’s a talented DL with the size and strength but he’s missing consistency. He can come in and be a rotational piece on the DL but if he develops he could be a good starter.
DL Siaki Ika Baylor 79
info: 18 pressures 0 sacks 20 tackles 69.1 RDEF 76.2 PRSH.
pros: Great size at 6’4 358, he can easily play the nose. Rare combo of size and quickness, can move like he’s 300 pounds not 350. Fires off the ball low and plays with a strong base.
cons: A nose tackle only most likely which is going to drive his stock down. Can get moved against double teams, doesn’t brace for the second OL well.
take: Ika is the prototypical NT with his large frame and strong base he can hold down the middle of a defense. He’s also a lot quicker than you would think at that size, he can pull out a spin move or a quick swim as well. He should be able to step in and play NT in the NFL and only get better from here.
LB Trenton Simpson Clemson 79
info:  51 tackles 70.3 RDEF 72.1 TACK 66 PRSH 63.6 COV.
pros:  Dad was in the military so he has a great attitude. 5 star athlete that is a true junior. 6’3 235 and a great athlete, he is the prototypical LB. Moves very well on the field, makes quick movements and has the agility to bend and change direction. Top level testing numbers, as good an athlete you will get at LB. When he recognizes a play he bursts to it and can finish any play.
cons:  Didn’t live up to the 5 star and physical attributes. Didn’t play much true LB where he would fill gaps and play coverage from the box instead of way out in the slot. A lot of reps on the edge but he isn’t long enough or refined enough to play there. Can get toasted in man coverage, good routes beat him easily.
take:  Simpson has all the talent in the world and not reason he shouldn’t be the best player on the field. Unfortunately he has never played well in a traditional linebacker mold, he’s not great in coverage and he doesn’t read plays that well. He could be a solid starter for a team but in a Devin White or Patrick Queen role, don’t ask him to play LB, make him blitz and make plays that require a top level athlete.
QB Tanner Mckee Stanford 79
info: Mckee was a 4 star recruit coming out of Centennial CA but before enrolling at Stanford he took a 2 year LDS mission in Brazil. He didn't play over Davis Mills in 2020 but he got the stating spot in 2021 and played solid with a 69 PFF grade and 2,325 yards and 15 TDs with 7 INTs.  His 2022 was similar but he did improve his grade to a 75 with 3,000 yards and 13 TDs and 8 INTs as well as being a team captain.
pros: Keeps the ball out of harms way well, only a 1.5% TWP. Good height, 6’6 can easily see over the line. Makes some great NFL throws with touch down the sideline. Solid arm strength and accuracy, probably would dominate at OSU. Had to deal with a terrible team around him, played well for circumstances.
cons: Production was meh, under 3000 yards and only 13 TDs. Takes a lot of sacks, a little uncoordinated looking. Long release, takes a little to long for the ball to come out of the hand. Plays with a narrow base a lot, he needs to be able to quickly release the ball with all the sacks he takes. Doesn’t extend plays well and make them by himself.
take: Mckee is an intriguing prospect, he is a big strong armed accurate QB with good arm strength. He’s a little like Daniel Jones which isn’t the prototype QB you look for anymore.
WR Josh Downs North Carolina 79
info: Downs was a 4 star recruit out of Suwanee GA where he was an All State player as well as a triple jump and long jump star. He committed to North Carolina to play with Sam Howell and learn behind Dyamni Brown. After Brown went to the NFL Downs stepped up and became the teams number 1 catching 101 balls for 1,335 yards and solidified himself as one of the nations top WRs. He came back in 2022 and caught 94 yards for 1,029 yards and 11 TDs which was good enough to be an All American.
pros: Back to back 1,000 yard seasons with 195 receptions over the 2 years. Fixed drop issue in 2022 only dropping 3% of his targets. Top tier ball skills, can rise up over defenders to make a play. Good athlete, has great speed and can make plays with the ball in his hands.
cons: 5’10 175, a very small build for a receiver. Not the quick and twitch elite level you want for a guy his size. Almost exclusively worked from the slot.
take: Downs is going to be helped out by how well Jahan Dotson played in 2022. They have similar skill sets with solid hands good speed and being undersized. He should be able to step into a teams slot receiver role and play immediately.
CB Joey Porter Penn St 78
info: 0 INT 9 PBU 24 tackles 57.7 TACK 77.4 COV.
pros: Good size at 6’2 198. Has the prototypical outside corner build, good speed long arms and good size. Physical at the line, he wont be bullied in press.
cons: Not a twitched up athlete, his change of direction and acceleration are only ok. Only one INT in 4 years, needs to play the ball better. Has to be grabby because his feet are not quick.
take: Porter is a big press corner that has played pretty well for Penn State over his career. He has all the tools to be a starting corner in the league but he’s not there yet. He’s feet are not good enough so he gets very grabby or beat badly.
EDGE BJ Ojulari LSU 78
info: 49 pressures 9 sacks 35 tackles 70.9 RDEF 81.5 PRSH.
pros: Brother of Azeez who was a second-round pick for the Giants. True junior, will just turn 21 before the draft and already as near 2,000 SEC snaps. Wore number 18 at LSU representing a high character player. Great burst off the edge, he is a serious threat to beat tackles up the field. Quick and violent hands, can swim past a tackle easily. Very good athlete that plays with a high motor to chase down plays. Has nice counters to moves already and is relentless when he’s rushing. Has good rush technique, whether that be a dip and rip or an swim/spin.
cons: May not have the ideal size, he looks a little slim on tape, at 6’3 250 would like to be a tad bigger. Needs to win with speed but his bend isn’t at the elite level you would like to see. Power in the run game will be an issue especially early on.
take: Ojulari will open his career as a pass rush specialist. He’s a great athlete that already has the moves to get to the QB and the motor to chase down plays. He’s on the smaller side which will limit him on early/run downs but the pass rushing upside it there.
EDGE Derick Hall Auburn 78
info: 47 pressures 8 sacks 43 tackles. 61 RDEF 82.2 PRSH.
pros: Great length, 6’3 252 with 34.5 inch arms. 3 straight years of 80+ PFF pass rush grades. The best long arm in the class, can do either hand and walk tackles back. Good motor and is always trying to get to the QB. Has a solid get off and can get to the edge because of it.
cons: Not much of a run defender, too many plays where he needs to be more physical and make a play. One trick pony, he has a long arm and that is it.
take: Hall is a powerful long edge defender that uses his strengths well. He has a lethal long arm move and can get off the block to finish the play on the QB. He’s only average in the run game though where he can lose the runner too easy and not make the play on them. He’s a sure fire NFL edge player, how good he can be is up to the continued development to set up his long arm even better.
EDGE Will Mcdonald Iowa St 78
info: 25 pressures 6 sacks 27 tackles 70.7 RDEF 84.1 PRSH.
pros: Great length, at 6’3 he has 35 inch arms. 4 straight years of 6+ sacks, great production. Had a 13 sack year in 2021, he has the pass rush pedigree. Lead the nation in pass rush win rate in true pass set situations. Great athlete for the position, can explode off the line and change direction well.
cons:  A tad undersized at 6’3 240, ideally he would put on 10 more pounds. Not very strong, can get pushed around in the run game.
take: Mcdonald is a very good pass rusher that has the production to back that up. He’s a long armed and good athlete that can give tackles trouble in the pass game. He seems to be a pass rush only kind of player though, he has a slim build and never wows you with power.
LB Drew Sanders Arkansas 78
info: 63 tackles 70.8 RDEF 57.2 TACK 75.3 PRSH 74.3 COV.
pros: 6’5 232, he’s a good MLB size. Former 5 star recruit that switched positions and graded as a 77.8 in his lone year starting in the SEC. Had 11 sacks as a LB can be a hybrid edge. Long rangy LB that can make plays sideline to sideline. Very good recognition and an aggressive LB that will blow up run plays.
cons: One year starter that couldn’t find the field at Alabama. Missed nearly 20% of his tackles in 2022. Not the best in coverage, still needs to learn route concepts so he can cover them. Not a very strong backer, a little slim so he can get moved in the run game.
take: Sanders is an interesting prospect, he has one year at off ball LB and he showed out. He’s a long fluid athlete that showed great effort and good recognition in the run game. He’s got the versatility to line up at edge as well making him a threat. If he learns more about playing off ball LB in coverage and adds some mass he can be special.
LB Jack Campbell Iowa 78
info: 83 tackles 85.6 RDEF 81.3 TACK 65.3 PRSH 92.9 COV.
pros: 2022 Butkus Award winner and an All American as well as a team captain. Made a massive jump in 2022 to become the nations top LB. Had back to back 80+ tackle seasons. Had a 92.9 coverage grade with 2 INTs, he’s a smart player that understands the game. 6’5 246, perfect MLB size. Good IQ, identifies run plays quickly to fill his gap and does a good job in the pass game finding receivers behind him. Good at meeting blockers in the hole and getting off the block to make a play.
cons: He lacks the aggressiveness in his game to make huge plays, doesn’t fly through the line to meet the RB in the backfield. Not a top end athlete, he is a little slow accelerating which hurts when he is guarding the slot.
take: Campbell is your prototypical MLB, with the great size and production you love to see at the college level. He’s missing the top end athleticism that will get you drafted in the first round but he is a good football player and should be an immediate starter.
OG O’Cyrus Torrence Florida 78
info: 3,065 career snaps 89.9 RBLK 76.1 PBLK 8 pressures.
pros: Big guard at 6’5 347 and has played both sides. A lot of experience and all of it has been good play. Showed that he was as good at Florida in the SEC as he was at LA Lafayette. 0 carrier sacks allowed, has a very strong anchor and is tough to bull rush. Good power in the run game, can be a real people mover.
cons: Has very little laterally agility to his game, can struggle with quick rushers. Jalen Carter beat him pretty bad on most plays, can’t handle quickness.
take: Torrence is a massive man that plays power football at a high level. He has issues in pass protection with speed and his lack of quickness but he has the potential to clean that up. He should be able to step in immediately and play guard.
OT Darnell Wright Tennessee 78
info: 2,746 career snaps 65 RBLK 80.2 PBLK 8 pressures.
pros: Started at both left and right tackle. Good size at 6’6 335. Pretty good hands, the placement is good and has a strong grip. Strong overall player, can move guys and anchor well in pass pro.
cons: Not an athlete, is very mediocre in space and has trouble working to the 2nd level. Waist bender, doesn’t move his feet well and leans on guys.
take: Wright is your classic big guy that can handle power but speed can get him. He’s not athletic enough to be one of the top tackles in the NFL but he can certainly start for a team.
S Jordan Battle Alabama 78
info: 42 tackles 1 INT 72.5 RDEF 77.3 TACK 85.2 COV.
pros: 4 year starter at Alabama and is 6’1 205, he looks the part. Graded above 80 for the past 3 years. Seems to always be in a solid position, never blowing coverages.
cons: He’s not the top tier athlete that gets drafted very high. Missed too many tackles in his career. Not a great man cover player, the athleticism is lacking.
take: Battle is an NFL safety, the world has know that for 3 years now. He’s so solid that he’s as high a floor prospect as you can get, he’s smart and has the physical ability to play in the NFL. He will be a starter for many years in the league.
WR Rashee Rice SMU 78
info: 96 receptions 1,344 yards 10 TDs.
pros: 6’3 205, has a good build for the position. Amazing at adjusting to the ball mid air and winning 50/50. Good speed for his size, can run away from defenders. Good with the ball in his hands, can make defenders miss easily. Was the number one guy his final year and got better every year.
cons: Played at SMU so not the best competition he went against. Didn’t see many advanced routes or technique, usually won on simple go’s or hitches and him being more physical.
take: Rice developed into a star for SMU in 2022, doubling his production from the previous year. He played against weaker competition that you would have liked to see but he’s such a physically gifted receiver that he will not be out of place in the NFL. If he can continue to progress he will be a star in the NFL.
WR Zay Flowers Boston College 78
info: 78 receptions 1,077 yards 12 TDs.
pros: Put up 3,000 career yards and 29 TDs. Makes some nice plays on the ball down the field, can adjust well. Shifty and fast, with space he can be electric.
cons: 5’10 170, he’s a very small receiver. Drops are an issue at 10.8% career drop rate. Haven’t seen him beat press too much, may be a slot only.
take: Flowers is another small explosive receiver that has good athleticism but the size may limit him. He’s very good with the ball in his hands and can make plays down the field so that should make him a viable receiver in the NFL. Its to be determined if he has the ability to translate to the NFL but with his athleticism its worth a shot.
CB Clark Phillips Utah 77
info: 4 INT 6 PBU 22 tackles 37 TACK 86.3 COV.
pros: PAC 12 defensive player of the year. Very good athlete, moves very well. Instinctive and smart, see’s plays happening very fast to make breaks on the ball. Very aggressive corner, willing to throw his body around and make a play.
cons: A smaller corner at 5’10 183. Missed an absurd 28% of his tackles in 2022. Wish he was longer so he could play press man better.
take: If Clark Phillips was 2 inches taller and a tad bigger he’d be a top 10 pick. He plays the game at such a high level, but he really struggles with his biggest weakness. He’s small and misses too many tackles, for all the good anticipation he has he still needs to make the play. Phillips may be one of the top CBs in the league if he become a more physical player and can bring down NFL ball carriers.
CB Deonte Banks Maryland 77
info: 1 INT 8 PBU 29 tackles 89.2 TACK 74.3 COV.
pros: Good size, 6’2 205. Only missed one tackle in 2022. Good in press, looks fluid defending go routes and playing physical. Good technique in press, gets hands on well.
cons: Missed 2021 do to a shoulder injury. Not that good of an athlete, not twitchy and the top end speed isn’t quite there.
take: Banks is a solid boundary corner with the size and length to play right now. He’s not a great athlete, the twitch and speed is alright but not special for sure.
DL Tuli Tuipulotu USC 77
info: 56 pressures 13 sacks 25 tackles 75.9 RDEF 81.2 PRSH.
pros: True junior with back to back 82 PFF grades. Has some nice pass rush moves from both the edge an interior, has a nice jump swipe and wins to the outside. Violent hands in the pass game, can swim and throw guys well. Good blend of athleticism and size, can’t teach that.
cons: A little bit of a tweener, 6’4 290 he played a lot of edge in college. Won’t hold up to the run well in the interior. Wont threaten NFL tackles with speed.
take: Tuipulotu is a bit of a tweener, he’s too small to hold up well in the interior and not a good enough athlete for edge only. That being said a team can work to get him in a more defined role and he already has the ability to play both.
EDGE Andre Carter Army 77
info: 23 pressures 4 sacks 30 tackles 72.2 RDEF 80.8 PRSH.
pros: Great build, 6’6 252 with 34 inch arms. Has a solid get off that threatens tackles vertically. Works hard to get around the edge and make a play on the QB, high motor. Nice counters already in his game without much coaching I’m assuming. Great overall athlete, can change direction, bend and accelerate at a top tier level.
cons: Played at army so wasn’t seeing great competition. Clearly still needs to be coached on the run game, needs to improve to be able to play against NFL comp. Plays high too often, he got away with it but needs to lower his pads.
take: Carter is an interesting prospect, he’s a physical freak that is still pretty raw even though he racked up over 10 sacks in 2021. He can move at an elite level for his size but the strength and level of competition can be concerning. With coaching and continued physical development Carter could be an All Pro edge player.
EDGE Zach Harrison Ohio St 77
info: 33 pressures 6 sacks 18 tackles 78.4 RDEF 85.2 PRSH.
pros: Great size at 6’6 272 as well as a 5 star recruit. Never graded poorly and had 3 straight 85+ PRSH grades. 91.1 PRSH grade on true pass sets with a 27.7 win rate. 35.75 inch arms, he’s freaky long. Strong in the run game, can keep tackles off him and set an edge.
cons: Tight hips and can’t bend an edge well. Not consistent firing off the ball, if he doesn’t jump the snap he’s a tad slow off the ball. Not much of a pass rush plan, he only uses power and a swim.
take: Harrison is made in a lab physically to play edge, the 6’6 270 pound defender. He has the strength, long arms and violent hands to be a starter in the league. He may not be quick enough or have enough bend to be a top tier edge but he certainly can start in the league.
OT Cody Mauch North Dakota St 77
info: 2,461 career snaps 90.1 RBLK 81.7 PBLK 9 pressures.
pros: My man looks like a lineman, 2 missing teeth and long hair. Graded very well for PFF, 90.8 overall grade in 2022 with only 9 pressures. Improved every year getting stronger and better. Got that dawg in him, wants to finish ever block with the defender on the ground. Some impressive run blocking reps that make you belive he has the power to play in the NFL.
cons: Definitely undersized, at just 303 pounds and short arms it will be tough to handle NFL power. 5th year player that already had to add so much size on his frame. Very sloppy feet in pass pro, the base gets way too narrow and his sets are not the best. Plays very high, need to sink his hips more to get better leverage.
take: Mauch is a solid athlete even after putting on so much weight in his college career. He’s a tenacious run blocker that has upside, but his technique and power are just huge question marks. He’s a solid developmental tackle to have, once he cleans up his technique he could be a starter.
OT Tyler Steen Alabama 77
info: 3,057 snaps 64.7 RBLK 74.4 PBLK 23 pressures.
pros: 6’5 315 and played at Bama, has the makeup of a solid tackle prospect. Played a lot of SEC football and was solid as a freshman and from both RT and LT. Shows the ability to have perfect pass sets with very good hands. Good IQ recognizing blitzes and DL stunts.
cons: Revery speed isn’t the best, can get his feet tangled at times. Power is lacking, can get pushed back too easily and doesn’t create much movement in the run game.
take: Steen is probably one of the most NFL ready tackles in this class. He’s very experienced and it seems Bama’s coaching has paid off with him showing great reps in pass pro. He’s missing the high end physical traits to be a dominating tackle but he certainly can play at the next level.
RB Roschon Johnson Texas 77
info: 94 carries 545 yards and 5 TDs
pros: 4 star dual threat QB recruit, made the switch and was immediately a natural runner. Only one fumble in his career and never had a rush grade below 82. PFF had him as the most elusive back in NCAA. Not a fun guy to tackle, caused 46 missed tackles on 94 attempts. Powerful runner, at 6’2 220 he runs through defenders and has a lethal stiff arm. Has more shake in his game then expected, a few hurdles and noce jump cuts on his tape.
cons: Not much of a receiver, 5 drops and 56 reception in his career. Never ran for over 650 yards, he was never the starter. Not a top end athlete that will accelerate out of his cuts like the best do. Missing the top end speed to hit the home runs in space.
take: Johnson has been 2nd fiddle his entire career which is absurd because he may be the 2nd best RB in this class. If it wasn’t for a once in a decade talent like Robinson he would have been the talk of college football. The 6’2 220 pounder has all the makings of a star RB and should be coveted highly in the draft.
RB Zach Charbonnet UCLA 77
info: Charbonnet was a top 50 recruit coming out of Oaks Christian in Westlake Village CA. He committed to Michigan where he flashed before leaving when Blake Corum came into town with Hassan Haskins. He transferred to UCLA where he was their number one back and ran for over 1000 yards back to back years and 90 PFF grades. He finished his career as a first team all Big 12 RB and a top RB in the nation.
pros: Breaks tackles at a high level forcing 121 missed tackles in his 2 years as a starter. Prototypical back, he's 6'1 220 and is a good athlete that can play on all 3 downs. 2 fumbles in 566 career attempts. Production is outstanding, in 2021 he ran for 1,358 Yards 7.0 YPC and 14 TDs. Surprising wiggle for a big back like himself, can shake DBs in the open field. He has a good feel for breaking tackles in every way. Strong at the point of contact, willing to get north south for the extra yardage. Solid in pass pro, can get hands on and stun defenders.
cons: Had to transfer to the PAC-12 to become a star. Not fluid out of the backfield, doesn’t scare any defense. Doesn’t have the athleticism that you look for in a top back.
take: Charbonnet is the prototypical work horse back, he doesn’t need to come off the field because he does it all. He’s a big back that can play on 3rd down, make the right reads and break tackles. The only thing he’s missing is the next level athleticism.
RB Jahmyr Gibbs Alabama 77
info: Gibbs was a 3 star coming out of Dalton GA initially before leading the state in rushing with 2,554 rushing yards an 40 TDs as a senior. He got bumped up to a 4 start and got offers from the SEC power houses but stayed commited to Georgia Tech. For some reason he was a rotation piece for GT in his first 2 years rushing for a combined 1,200 yards and 8 TDS before transfering to Bama where he was their lead back.  He iwas an impact player for Bama and ran for over 920 yards and 7 TDs as a true junior with 0 fumbles to go with it.
pros: Home run hitter at RB, with a 6.2 YPC and 52.5% of his yards coming on break away runs he is dangerous to take any carry to the house.  He's a solid receiver, with an 82.3 receiving grade and only 2 career drops he can be dangerous out of the backfield. Runs crisp routes, is a problem when he has an option route against a LB. Elite athlete at RB, great speed to go along with being twitchy. Breaks 1 on 1 open field tackles easily.
cons: Struggled in pass pro at bama receiving a 24 PFF grade in 2022. Doesn’t have the best running style, a lot of big plays or a short gain. Isn’t patient and not decisive, he doesn’t set up blockers well and hit holes with conviction. Likes to bounce to the outside too often.
take: null
S Antonio Johnson Texas A&M 77
info: 55 tackles 0 INT 83.7 RDEF 70.2 TACK 79.7 COV.
pros: True junior that is 6’3 200. Had an 87.4 grade in 2021 as a true junior. Good in the box figuring out what the offense is doing. Physical player, will bring the hit stick with him.
cons: Only 1 INT in 800 coverage snaps. Awful wrap up tackler, will struggle in the NFL. Not the fluid middle of the field safety. Unknown if he can play the ball well.
take: Johnson is an aggressive box safety that wants to hit. He does a great job finding his way to the ball carrier and putting big hits on them. If he can add good coverage to his game he will be a legit pro bowl safety.
WR Nathaniel Dell Houston 77
info: 108 receptions 1,399 yards 17 TDs.
pros: Back-to-back 1,300 yard receiving seasons with 30 TDs. Amazing athlete, has the agility and speed you need to play at 165. Great deep threat with the ability to shake defenders deep and be wide open.
cons: Drops the ball more than you would like at 9%. 5’10 165, he’s a very small receiver. Played against lower level of competition than you would like.
take: Dell is Zay flowers but older and played at Houston. He’s way undersized but he’s such a great athlete he made up for it. He can be a teams return man as well as maybe develop into a deep threat out of the slot.
C Rickey Stromberg Arkansas 76
info: 3,121 career snaps 83.7 RBLK 77.1 PBLK 11 pressures.
pros: Solid size at 6’4 315 with 33 inch arms and 22 years old. 4 year starter that improved every year of his career. Good strength in the run game, can turn DL as well as drive LBs back. Has a solid anchor and a good feel for blitzes and stunts in pass pro.
cons: In the games where he played NFL talent you can see him struggle more than you would like. Leans a little too much in pass pro, needs to sink and play lower. Not high level athlete, wont wow anyone with blocks in space.
take: Stromberg is an impressive center, he can be dominate in the run game and he’s solid in pass pro. He checks all the boxes you want in a center and should be able to start as a rookie.
C Joe Tippmann Wisconsin 76
info: 1,456 career snaps 78 RBLK 79.2 PBLK 5 pressures.
pros: Wisconsin lineman that is 21 6’6 315 and has played good football every year. He has a sick mullet, he looks the part. Really good athlete for his size, can pull and play in space. Solid in pass pro, locks on defenders and keeps them infront of him. Solid strength, he can anchor well and shows plays in the run game where he can move the LOS
cons: At 6’6 he’s a high cut center, going to struggle to out leverage NTs. Not consistent with his use of power because of leverage. Can get off balance from bending at the waist too much because of height.
take: Weird to say but if Tippmann was about 2-3 inches shorter he may be an early day 2 pick. Many of his weaknesses are due to a lack of leverage but he’s a good athlete that’s young and has shown some power. He should be able to be a low end early on starter and develop into a solid center.
CB Garrett Williams Syracuse 76
info: Williams was a lightly recruited corner out of Hickory Ridge in Harrisburg NC. He committed to Syracuse where he played on special teams his 2019 season. He then took over across from Melifwanu to form a top tier secondary and was named to the Freshman All American team by the Athletic. He had a “down” 2nd season where he was an All-ACC HM allowing 33 receptions and 380 yards.
pros: Solid size, 6 foot 190 and looks the part. Breaks on screens and flat routes well.
cons: 
take: 
DL Gervon Dexter Florida 76
info: 25 pressures 2 sacks 36 tackles 70 RDEF 55.2 PRSH.
pros: True junior and a former 5 star, has potential to improve greatly. Good size at 6’6 312. Played over 600 snaps in 2022, he can play all game if needed. Good power to his game, can walk lineman back as well as hold his ground in the run game. Shows that he can put a pass rush move on the OL, may not be NFL level but he has a nice swim.
cons: Took a step back in 2022, his pass rush grade lowered below 60. Played a lot but also had plays where he looked tired and got no push. Plays very very high, needs to fire off the ball lower. Not a twitchy DL, he’s not going to wow any guard with a quick speed move.
take: Dexter is a prototypical 3 tech at 6’6 312 he can bull rush and hold up in the run game. He’s not there yet as a NFL starter, he plays high and isn’t advanced with his hands. If you give him time and coaching though he can turn into a very good starting DL.
DL Mazi Smith Michigan 76
info: 25 pressures 1 sack 38 tackles 81 RDEF 68 PRSH.
pros: Freaky athlete, was Feldmans number 1 payer at 337 he did 22 reps of 325 and has a sub 7 3 cone. Over 600 snaps in 2022, he can play a lot of snaps every game. Unreal play strength, just tosses OL around.
cons: 2 career sacks even though he is a freaky athlete. No pass rush to speak of, barely uses hands and doesn’t try to bull the OL often. Terrible get off, just kind of stands straight up.
take: For a 4th year senior he is so underdeveloped. He’s a physical freak, god only made so many people as strong as he is but he doesn’t use it well. He’s got no pass rush, barely gets off the ball and no hand technique. If he would develop he could be unstoppable.
EDGE Isaiah Foskey Notre Dame 76
info: 33 pressures 12 sacks 26 tackles 67.8 RDEF 73.1 PRSH.
pros: Team captain for Notre Dame. Solid size at 6’5 262 and 33.75 inch arms. Good athlete, can get around the edge and bend to make a play. Solid hands, will swipe hands off him and try to re fit to get good leverage.
cons: Plays with poor balance, on the ground too often. Not a very powerful edge player, won’t bull many tackles and may get pushed in the run game.
take: Foskey has the makeup of a good edge rusher. He’s a 6’5 260 pound team captain with multiple 10 sack seasons. He’s missing the top level ability that is what you look for in high ceiling players, but he’s got good ability and should be an impact NFL player.
EDGE Felix Anudike-Uzomah Kansas St 76
info: 46 pressures 8 sacks 34 tackles 74.6 RDEF 73 PRSH.
pros: True junior, played at a very high level as a true sophomore. Has the size, speed and strength to play edge in the NFL. Has won around the edge and has won with power rushes.
cons: Didn’t improve or follow up on a great 2021 season. Not a great athlete, lacks the bust you would like to see out of an edge. Good tackles get their hands on him easily and the rep is over.
take: Anuike-Uzomah looks like an NFL edge, he would not be out of place on an NFL field. I struggle to see his upside though, better competition can shut down his pass rush and he’s lacking the top end traits. He could be a solid starter in the NFL but that is probably his ceiling.
LB Daiyan Henley Washington St 76
info: 74 tackles 68.7 RDEF 90.3 TACK 75.1 PRSH 68.6 COV
pros: Only missed 5 tackles in 2022. Originally was a WR so he has some real athleticism and ball skills, he had 4 INTs in 2021. Very good in man, good athlete that can cover TE’s easily. Willing to come up and hit OL and run through ball carriers. Shows the ability to slip right past blockers in the run and pass game to make plays in the backfield. Moves great for an inside LB, has great burst and good bend.
cons: 5th year senior with only one year at the FBS level. A little shoer for the position at just under 6’1, but he has decent length. Not a refined LB, can tell he’s not processing the game at the highest level yet, he’s more of an attack player.
take: Henley is an interesting prospect, he started at WR before putting some muscle on and moving the LB. He has great athleticism for the position and can immediately find a role in the NFL on pass downs for sure. If he continues to learn more and more about LB and become more instinctive he will be a great NFL LB.
OG Steve Avila TCU 76
info: 2,297 career snaps 66.6 RBLK 83.6 PBLK 11 pressures.
pros: Great size, 6’4 330 is what you would draw a guard up as. Good power in the run game, can move people vertically. Good hands in pass pro, tight punches and good extension.
cons: Slow feet and slow to react to stunts because of it. Some head scratching missed assignments possibly. Not a athlete, more of just a big body for gap schemes.
take: Avila is a big strong lineman that can play in a phone booth. He’s not very quick and he has some mental lapses but he’s got the size and strength you can’t teach.
QB Hendon Hooker Tennessee 76
info: Hooker was a 4 star recruit coming out of the DMV area with offers to nearly all the schools in area. He chose to go to the best of the schools Virginia Tech where he redshirted and then took over the staring spot a few weeks into his freshman season. He transferred to Tennessee in 2021 and took the starting spot from highly thought of QB Joe Milton and was great for the Vols. His 2021 season was fantastic and that continued into his senior year where he was in the Heisman running until his ACL non-contact injury week 12 against South Carolina. He finished his Tennessee career with 6,000 yard 58 TDs with only 5 INTs and a win over Alabama which was the first if the decade for the Vols.
pros: Doesn’t put the ball in harms way, under 2% Turnover worthy play rate in his final 2 years. Good mobility, can add to the run game as a QB as well as escape the pocket and get yards with his legs. Good quick release with good feet on almost all of his throws. Great short accuracy, screens and quick game throws are nearly perfect all the time. Put up the stats and wins in the SEC.
cons: 24 years old, one of the older prospects you will see. Doesn’t have the top-level arm talent where he can make off platform and deep throws down the sideline as well as a top level QB can. Would like to see more anticipatory throws, likes to see it open more than throw it open. Not the most precise passer when adding extra zip to the ball, can sail on him from time to time.
take: Hooker has the makeup of a top quarterback prospect, he’s a great decision make, a winner and has no big weaknesses to his game. The only issue with him as a prospect is his age and lack of trump card. He’s a good runner and has a solid NFL arm but he doesn’t have the wow plays to go at the top of the draft.
RB Tank Bigsby Auburn 76
info: Bigsby has never flown under the radar, as a high 4 star recruit, he had offers from everywhere including his first offer from Bama as a Sophomore. He went to school in LaGrange GA where he rushed for over 2,200 yards but didn't go to his hometown Georgia Bulldogs, he committed to Auburn where he immediately saw the field. He rushed for 834 yards and was named the SEC Freshman of the year. He came back as the full-time starter in 2021 where he got 224 carries and rushed for 1,100 yards and 10 TDs. His final year in 2022 was by far the most impressive he ran for 976 yards but a whopping 700 of them came after contact. He forced 60 missed tackles and averaged 4.16 yards after contact.
pros: Stepped up as a junior, forcing 60 missed tackles and had 740 yards after contact he was Auburns rushing attack. All around back that has good speed the ability to change directions well and enough power to fall forward. Has breakaway speed once he’s in the open field he can keep his distance from defenders. Solid contact balance, arm tackles look like they don’t affect him. Shown every year that he can run in the SEC at a high level.
cons: Fumbled 4 times in 2021, he cleaned it up in 2022 but still concerning. Not much receiving experience out of the backfield. Not the best back at setting up defenders to be blocked or taken out of the play. Not elite at any one thing, doesn’t have the elite speed/quickness or strength. Runs high which loses him a lot of power.
take: Bigsby is a very good running back with the track record to prove it. He has all the tools to be a good RB in the NFL he’s just lacking a selling point to get a team really excited. If he can develop his receiving/blocking into a strength he will be a great all around 3 down back.
RB Dewayne Mcbride UAB 76
info: Mcbride was a low 3 star recruit out of Starke FL and had very little interest so he went to UAB. He was a playmaker his true freshman year averaging 0.3 yards per carry on 47 attempts which lead him to be the starter in 2021. He ran for 1,366 and 13 TDs and had 78 forced missed tackles. 2022 blew that out of the water when he ran 1,702 yards 19 TDs and had a 94.1 PFF grade. He was named conference USA player of the year and solidified himself as one of the best backs in college football.
pros: Never had below a 90 PFF run grade in his 3 years. Had a career 7.2 YPC with 4.93 yards after contact and 175 forced missed tackles. Well built back with solid athleticism, he’s 5-11 215 and is a pretty good athlete that will meet all the thresholds. Amazing contact balance, spins out of sure tackles and keeps the feet moving at all times. Very strong, can squat 550 and bench 385.
cons: Fumbling could be an issue, 9 fumbles on 484 carries. Did all his work against a lower level of competition, probably wont be as successful at breaking tackles against higher level competition. Not a twitched up runner, wont shake anyone or accelerate that well.
take: Mcbride was incredible against UAB’s competition, he is a very strong back that can break tackles and do everything else pretty well. He’s not the best athlete at the position though, the speed acceleration and agility are all ok but isn’t something to get excited about. It is very easy to project Mcbride to be a starting RB at the next level given his ability to run between the tackles and make people miss.
TE Darnell Washington Georgia 76
info: 28 receptions 454 yards 2 TDs.
pros: He sticks out on a field of SEC players by towering over everyone, he’s 6’7 270. True junior who player all 3 years with above a 68 PFF grade. Almost like having an extra OL, 81 run block grade. Solid as a check down receiver, wont just be an extra OL.
cons: Never was a volume TE receiver, 45 career receptions. Will never be a receiving threat, he’s just a guy as a receiver.
take: Washington has his clear strength and that’s run blocking, he’s a massive TE with the ability to contribute to the pass game. He’s not going to be an impact receiving threat ever but he should be able to easily contribute to a team.
TE Luke Musgrave Oregon St 76
info: 11 receptions 169 yards 1 TD.
pros: 6’6 250, a very good TE build. Good and smooth athlete, can play from the slot. Was on Bruce Feldmans freak list, a versatile athlete with good testing numbers.
cons: Injured his knee after the 2nd game of the season in 2022. Not much of a run blocker. Not many targets but a 16% drop rate. Not great at finding open space and creating separation.
take: Musgrave is very much a developmental TE, he’s got the size and athleticism to be a good TE in the league but we haven’t seen it yet. The early season injury hurt the chances but he’s worth a mid round flyer.
WR Marvin Mims Oklahoma 76
info: 54 receptions 1,082 yards 6 TDs.
pros: 19.5 Yards per catch, he’s a solid deep threat. 89 PFF receiving grade as a true freshman. Good athlete, very fluid in space and can punt return. Good with the ball, slippery to tackle, guys slide right off him even at 185. Great ball skills, made some unreal catches. True junior that produced every year at OK.
cons: 5’11 184, would like to see him add size. Played in a OK system where there is nothing but space to deal with.
take: Mims was a stud recruit breaking Texas state records in high school and immediately made an impact in college. He has the athleticism and ball skills that are going to translate to the next level. He’s on the smaller side though which may limit him as a number 2 option, but he has the ability to be a good NFL WR.
WR Jalin Hyatt Tennessee 76
info: Hyatt was a 4 star recruit out of Dutch Fork HS in SC where he led his team to back to back undefeated seasons while breaking his HS's receiving records .He initially committed to play of the Hokies before flipping his commitment to Tennessee. His Freshman year he got on start and had some use getting 276 receiving yards and 2 TDs. his sophomore year was more of the same but really broke out in 2022 and developed a great connection with Hendon Hooker. In 2022 he won the Biletnikoff and was named to the 1st team All SEC team after racking up 1,267 yards and 15 TDs.
pros: Accolades his senior year where as good as it gets. Great speed, can put on the burners and pull away from people. Solid hands, not just a speed guy who can't catch, he can catch through contact.
cons: One year of being a full time starter. Mostly a slot receiver in college, 87% of his snaps from there. Only got a 77 PFF grade, not whatyou expect from the Biletnikoff winner. Very thin frame, needs to add some size for NFL physicality. Awful out of the break and off the line, not quick just fast.
take: Hyatt can run fast, that's about where the positives end. He's not a polished receiver, he's not good out of breaks and doesn't do well with physicality. His top end outcome is a deep threat only.
LB Henry To’oto’o Alabama 75
info: 70 tackles 72.1 RDEF 59.8 TACK 61.4 PRSH 66.6 COV.
pros: Over 3000 career SEC snaps, he has seen a lot of high level football. Made a solid jump in play his final year at Bama. Fantastic football IQ, he knows what to do on every play and can anticipate plays coming. Good athlete that does a pretty good job in coverage. Can dip under OL and make plays behind the LoS.
cons: 3 career pass breakups, nearly no ball production in coverage. Never graded that well, highest was a 70 other than that he was in the 50’s. On the smaller side at under 230, he will have to bulk up a little bit more. Not the strongest, can get bullied by OL and big RBs. Sometimes can struggle locating the ball, he’s in a solid spot but cant figure out where to go from there.
take: To’oto’o is another very good Alabama LB that understands the game at a high level. He’s a solid athlete with so much experience that he wont be thrown off by the NFL game. He’s on the small side though and that shows up in his tape when he loses to guys with good power. He could become a solid starter but without the play strength it will be tough for him.
OG Andrew Vorhees USC 75
info: 3,491 career snaps 82.5 RBLK 80.1 PBLK 15 pressures
pros: Good size, 6’6 325. Had a 90.1 grade in 2021. Decent play strength, can hold up to NFL power if needed.
cons: He came into college in 2017, he’s already 24. Took a step back in 2022 from a 90 to 81. Plays high and not always with good balance, needs to play lower and with more control. Not the best athlete, mediocre lateral quickness.
take: Vorhees is a old prospect that still needs some work. He’s got the size and strength to play but he didn’t dominate like a 6th year senior should. He can end up starting for a team at guard but he will need to continue to improve.
OT Zion Nelson Miami 75
info: 2,452 snaps 65 RBLK 85.3 PBLK 15 pressures.
pros: Was the starting LT for Miami as a true freshman in 2019. Improved greatly from his freshman year becoming a formidable tackle by his true junior year. Had a solid pass blocking game against Jermaine Johnson in 2021. Moves at an elite level for a LT, he’s so smooth and fast in pass pro.
cons: 2022 season was negated by a knee injury. Needs to add strength, the anchor wasn’t enough in 2021. Needs to work on hand placement to avoid defenders getting to his chest.
take: Nelson would have been benefited from a big time senior year which he was on track for. He already flashed his potential by showing with great movement skills and ability to get the job done in pass pro. All he needs to do is work on the anchor of his in pass pro because if he can do that we are looking at a top tier pass protector.
RB Zach Evans Ole Miss 75
info: Evans was an absolute star coming out of North Shore in TX where he and Bijan were RBs 1 and 2 coming out of HS. He led his team to back to back 6A division 1 state championships while rushing for over 10 YPC. As a sophomore in HS the offers started to roll in, he got an offer from LSU and many other schools before ultimately deciding to go to TCU. He was a big play waiting to happen at TCU, he wasn't the starter but he was averaging over 7 YPC and forcing missed tackles left and right. He transferred to Ole Miss and became their starter along side Quinshon Judkins and had a solid season with 930 yards 6.5YPC and 9 TDs.
pros: Talented back that was always highly thought of, even when he was at TCU everyone knew he was an RB1 talent. Great speed and power combo, will run you over and then past pursuing defenders. Runs low to the ground, great leverage when driving forward in piles. Loves getting north and south, isn’t afraid to hit the crease and grind for extra yards. Very strong lower half, easily slips arm tackles as well and run through people.
cons: Too many times the ball is on the ground, he dropped 5 out of 30 balls and fumbles 3 times in 2021. Was not a good pass protector grading at a 29.6 PFF grade. Never was the lead back, always sharing the roll and never being the guy. Never did much outside of run it, not many receiving opportunities or pass pro.
take: Evans is a no nonsense RB, usually you think of bigger backs like that but at 6 foot 215 he packs a punch and will run through you. He’s an Zeke Elliot type runner but a big unknown of his game is the pass pro and receiving ability.
RB Kenny Mcintosh Georgia 75
info: 2022 stats: 151 carries 824 yards 10 TDs.
pros: 45 missed tackles forced on 151 carries. Very good out of the backfield, 92 and 86 PFF Rec grades in 2021 and 2022 with a career 75 receptions for 865 yards. Amazing hands, can track and pluck a ball out of the air down the field and also can run nice routes. Runs with good pad level even though he’s on the taller side. Pretty elusive, can run through contact and has a good feel for side stepping tackles.
cons: Never was the work horse back, always being the second guy or sharing the backfield. He doesn’t have the juice that you want in an RB, he isn’t great at accelerating or changing direction.
take: Mcintosh’s calling card is his receiving ability, he clearly has the talent to be a solid NFL RB but his work out of the backfield is what he’s special at. He’s lacking the short area quickness that you want to see in an RB but he does everything else at a high level.
TE Sam Laporta Iowa 75
info: 58 receptions 648 yards 1 TD.
pros: Good with the ball in his hands, 20 missed tackles forced. Good athlete, mover very well for a TE and can run WR routes. Iowa TE, not a stranger to blocking inline.
cons: Drops can be a concern for him. Doesn’t have the strength to be a good run blocker, they had him as a big slot a lot.
take: Laporta probably isn’t the next George Kittle just because he’s an Iowa TE. He’s a good athlete that’s a little undersized which hurts his run blocking. He is similar to Kittle in the fact that he’s good with the ball in his hands but he will need to get stronger to become a good NFL TE.
WR Xavier Hutchinson Iowa St 75
info: 107 receptions 1,171 yards 6 TDs
pros: good production catching over 100 balls in 2022 with an 89.4 receiving grade. Good hands, only a 4.9% career drop rate. Good routes/releases, can get off press and create separation initially. Long limbed, 6’3 and can extend to make plays on the ball. Great ball skills, does a great job reacting to the throw and getting in position to make a catch.
cons: Not very fast, isn’t threatening the defense vertically. Not quick out of breaks, he wont shake any DBs and break away from them.
take: Hutchinson was a big part of Iowa States offense, when they needed a 1st down he was their guy. He is a reliable big framed receiver that can make plays on the ball. He’s lacking that next gear though, he wont run past anyone or make anyone fear his athleticism.
LB Noah Sewell Oregon 74
info: 40 tackles 62.4 RDEF 70 TACK 73.5 PRSH 72.6 COV.
pros: Brother of Penei, athleticism runs in the family. 6’2 250, he’s got great size for the position. Immediately graded as a 70 for PFF in his true freshman 2020 season. Great at taking on blocks, can stand his ground and shed them easily. Solid pass rusher, has some edge moves and is a powerful blitzer. Strong athlete that plays hard, the tools are there for him to play in the NFL.
cons: Didn’t improve in PFF grade from 2020, stayed stagnant. Not the quickest LB, change of direction and acceleration are not his selling points. Doesn’t seem to have great instincts, he wont anticipate many plays and make the top end plays elite LBs make.
take: Sewell isn’t going to be a top pick like his brother but he’s a solid football player. He’s young and has great size with solid athleticism which teams will covet. He’s not the top end LB now because he doesn’t see the game the same way top end LBs do but if he gets there he’s a future pro bowl player.
OT Matthew Bergeron Syracuse 74
info: 2,539 career snaps 69 RBLK 80.9 PBLK 12 pressures.
pros: Improved over his 4 year career at Syracuse while getting a lot of experience. Has NFL size at 6’5 322. Solid in pass pro because he’s got solid size and decent athleticism. Good at picking up stunts and games from the DL.
cons: Loves to hold, a lot of missed holding calls on his tape. Inconsistent technique, oversets too much and doesn’t play with a strong posture leading him to lose balance. Not a mauler in the run game. Wasted motion with his punches, loads up hands and exposes his chest.
take: Bergeron has the size and movement skills you look for in an OT. Like most college OT’s there’s a lot he needs to work on technique wise but he’s a smart player that already has played solid. In a few years he could be a starting OT if he continues to develop.
RB Kendre Miller TCU 74
info: 224 carries 1,399 yards 17 TDs.
pros: Young prospect as a true junior, will be 20 when drafted. Ran for 1,400 yards and an 88.5 PFF grade in 2022. Solid size at 6’0 220. 70 missed tackles forced in 2022. He’s a jack of all trades, he can run past slower defenders and lower the shoulder to get extra yards. Good contact balance and has a good feel for making guys miss. Sets up blockers well with good patients and sees the blocks develop well before making his cut.
cons: Not much of a 3rd down back, low pass block grades and 16 receptions in 2022. One year of being the teams lead back and 6 fumbles in 361 attempts. Isn’t a top end athlete and doesn’t have overwhelming power. Can be a little indecisive at times, can get caught waiting for an opening rather than taking what he can get.
take: Miller was a key piece of TCU’s run to the national championship. He was a great runner for them with the size and ability to break big TD runs and get the extra yards when needed. He’s not the most explosive back but he’s already so good at such a young age he should be a contributing to an NFL team now and for many years.
RB Eric Gray Oklahoma 74
info: 212 carries 1,374 yards and 11 TDs.
pros: Rushing grade of 92.4 as a senior. Very elusive runner, good contact balance for size and bounces off DB’s. Can cut on a dime and completely throw off defenders angles. Has the speed and quickness to kill people in open space.
cons: Not a good pass blocker, struggled all 4 years. Didn’t run against many loaded boxes, Oklahoma’s offense was very spread out. Not a strong runner, won’t be running through many tackles. One year of being the starter and was 23 by the time he broke out.
take: Gray has some great highlights where he can make defenders look silly. He’s got great athleticism and moves very well in space. He’s not the most physically imposing back so he won’t be great all 3 downs but he can make plays in space that’s for sure.
RB Mohamed Ibrahim Minnesota 74
info: Ibrahim was a 3 star recruit coming out of Baltimore MD where he had a good career before committing to Minnesota. He redshirted in 2017 and in 2018 became the Minnesota Gophers 2nd leading rusher for a freshman behind Darrell Thompson. in 2019 for some reason he got less carries before having another 1000 yard season in 2020. He came back in 2021 ready to go absolutely gashing Ohio state for 160 and 2 TDs in 3 Quarters before going out for the season with an ankle injury. That led him to come back and only break Minnesota’s all time rushing record in his last bowl game against Syracuse.
pros: Production is great, 3 1,000 yard seasons and was consistent around 5.4 YPC. Over 2,200 yards after contact with 70 forced missed tackles. He’s a Damion Pierce light, absolute menace with the ball and not very fun to tackle. Strong back, easily runs secondary defenders over and pushes piles in short yards. Great contact balance, not an easy guy to bring down. Pretty good vision, will make you be gap discipline.
cons: Almost never was used in the pass game, 21 career receptions in 5 years. Older RB prospect, 5th year coming out. He is very slow changing direction and doesn’t have good speed.
take: Ibrahim is a great 2 down runner and would have been perfect in 1990. The game favors faster more explosive players now but that doesn’t mean theres no role for a throw back strong physical RB like him. He can be a great thunder to another backs lighting.
RB Devon Achane Texas A&M 74
info: Achane was a top 4 star RB coming out of Missouri City TX and somehow chose Texas A&M over the power house of Syracuse. He immediatley got playing time in 2020 where he got 43 carries for 364 yards and a 91 PFF grade. By his junior year he became there top RB and ran the ball 196 times for 1,100 yards and 8 TDs with an 89.8 run grade.
pros: 3 straight 89.8+ PFF rush grades with a total of 2,349 yards at 6.4 YPC. Forced 51 missed tackes with 705 of his 1,100 yards after contact. Could be an explosive change of pace back, he was amazing when he was used sparingly rather then the work horse. Produced with terrible blocking in front of him, not may opportunities for him to get free yards. Great cuts, can stop and start on a dime. Stronger contact balance that you would assume for a 180 pound back. Uses a stiff arm pretty well, can surprise defenders with a quick stiff arm. He has angle breaking speed, can get to the edge of the defense with ease. Good vision on zone concepts, rarely hits the wrong hole and makes the most of what he has.
cons: A terrible pass protector, 27.2 pass block grade with a 10% pressure rate. Small back at 180 who struggles to run up the middle, 3.7 YPC there. Not as effective when he has to carry the bulk of the work in the backfield, efficiency numbers significantly dropped in his lone year as the guy. Don’t love him in a man scheme, a little to bounce happy there.
take: Teams always are looking for a “home run hitter” at RB and that’s exactly what Achane is. He’s such a good athlete he makes defenders look silly, his jump cuts and speed leave defenders in the dust and is dangerous every time he has the ball. He has the ability to be a work horse but he’s most effective as a change of pace back that will take advantage of a tired defense.
RB Chase Brown Illinois 74
info: 329 carries 1,632 yards 10 TDs
pros: Lead the nation in yards and was the bell cow for Illinois. Has very good speed for the position, hit 22.5 MPH in a game. Pretty good vision, lets block develop and can bust through the line.
cons: 5th year player who only broke out his last year. Didn’t lead the league in rushing without an absurd number of carries. He’s on the slimmer side for the position, doesn’t run through contact well.
take: Brown was Illinois offense last year after 4 longer years of waiting to break out. He’s got the great speed to make in impact in the NFL but the strength is a real concern. He should be able to contribute to a backfield immediately.
RB Tyjae Spears Tulane 74
info: 231 carries 1,586 yards 19 TDs.
pros: 63 forced missed tackles and 4.55 yards after contact. Consistently high PFF grades all 4 years. Solid out of the backfield in his career. Has great agility and athleticism, can take advantage of small windows and create big plays.
cons: Small for the position, 5’11 195 he’s a slim back. All his targets are checkdowns. Didn’t play the highest level competition, could struggle with better physicality at the next level.
take: Spears has shown he is a good back for the last 2 years and solidified his place in the NFL in 2022. He’s a very good athlete with the production to back it up that he should be drafted. He’s on the smaller side though which will limit his draft stock but he could end up making an impact in the NFL.
WR Kayshon Boutte LSU 74
info: Boutte was a 5 star recruit out of New Iberia LA where he was an All State receiver and a highly sought after recruit. He chose to stay home and go to the National Champion LSU tigers, he was immediately thought of as their number 1 but he always seemed to fall short of the very high expectations. His career highs were 48 receptions, 735 yards and 9 TDs which are solid but not top WR numbers. His career came to an end in a very interesting end when he said he would return but some off field issues arose and he declared.
pros: 5 star recruit and a true junior. Solid build at 6 foot 200 and has good speed to go along with it.
cons: Has some off field concerns at LSU. Has drop issues, at 11% drop rate. Hate his effort on routes, he doesn’t work to get open and he’s lazy.
take: Boutte is a case of all the talent in the world but non of the effort. It makes me upset to watch such a physically talented WR play the way he does.
WR Parker Washington Penn St 74
info: 46 receptions 611 yards 2 TDs.
pros: Stocky build at 5’10 215 and a true junior. Good hands, 5% drop and a surprisingly high contested catch rate. Unreal ball skills, can catch a ball in any position and can catch away from his body. Can add YAC with his center of gravity and strong lower half.
cons: Never really was the alpha in the receiving core, best season came with Jahan Dotson as the number 1. Not that fast and shifty for the play style that would fit his build. Doesn’t create the separation with his routes that you would like from a 5’10 slot guy.
take: Washington is an interesting eval, he’s got a weird stocky build for the position and isn’t that top end athlete. But, he’s very good with the ball in his hands and can go pluck the ball out of the air if it’s within his range. He will be able to step in as a return man and if he gets craftier with his routes he could be a great slot.
C Olusegun Oluwatimi Michigan 73
info: 3,479 snaps 83 RBLK 76.7 PBLK 9 pressures.
pros: Very experienced guard that has played for 3 schemes (Air Force, Virginia, Michigan). Had a 90 RBLK grade in 2021 at Virginia. Does a good job picking up blitzes and stunts, has seen a lot of fronts. Good athlete, can pull and log around the line as well as mirror defenders. Good in double teams, always gets a good push and can climb to a backer.
cons: Would like to see a bigger center at 6’3 307. He’s Not the strongest OL and he doesn’t play with good pad level. Isn’t a dog in the run game, likes to just do enough and get in the way, not drive the defender back.
take: Oluwatimi is a very experienced center with good enough strength and solid athleticism. He wont do much to wow you on tape but he has a good IQ and gets the job done nearly every time. He can most likely step in and play if you need to fill in an interior spot in the OL.
C Jarrett Patterson Notre Dame 73
info: info: Patterson was a highly sought after recruit coming out of Mission Viejo in California. He choose to attend Notre Dame and put together a very nice career there. He was the starter his sophomore year and on for a dominate Notre Dame offensive line. His final year he was named a captain and acted as a leader for the team all year.
pros: 2 time Notre Dame team captain, he’s a leader with great experience. Great at picking up stunts and passing them off, very smooth in pass pro. Gives good effort in the run game and stays on his blocks.
cons: Took a step back in grading after switching to guards from center. Lacking the anchor/power to play high level guard, best position is center. Could work on his pad level, can let defenders get under him too often.
take: Patterson is a guy you want on your team, he’s a smart leader that has played a lot of football. He’s not going to wow you physically but he will be able to step in and not be overwhelmed by the NFL.
C Luke Wypler Ohio St 73
info: 1,702 career snaps 80.8 RBLK 84.1 PBLK.
pros: Top 2 center recruit in 2020, he’s still a young player. 2 straight solid years as the starter. Good athlete, moves exceptionally well in space. Works hard to stay on blocks.
cons: Small at 6’3 300. Gets out powered way too often, both in the run and pass.
take: Wypler is the typical college center in the fact that he is small at only 300 pounds. Where he differs is his athleticism, he’s a very toned down Linderbaum. He needs to add strength to his game but he’s young enough that it is a real possibility that he can down the line.
OT Blake Freeland BYU 73
info: 2,690 career snaps 87.9 RBLK 90.7 PBLK 7 pressures.
pros: 91 PFF grade in 2022, he has consistently graded well in PFFs system. Good length, 6’8 with 35 inch arms can keep defenders away from him. Smooth pass protector, can mirror pretty well and get hands on defenders. Smart in pass pro, see’s stunts well and can pass them off.
cons: He’s slim at 6’8 305, he can get out leveraged and bull rushed. A little soft at times, he gets pushed and thrown around a little too much. Weird pass set with his feet, needs to be re worked.
take: Freeland will be interesting to see if he pans out in the NFL. His style worked for him at BYU but the power and length of the NFL may get to him. He has the length and pass blocking ability to give teams hope but he needs to continue to work on his feet and strength.
QB Jaren Hall BYU 73
info: 3,162 yards 31 TD 6 INT 65.7% 82.4 PASS 72 RUN.
pros: 89 and 86 PFF grade in his 2 years starting at BYU. 52 TDs to 11 INTs in his career. Decent arm talent, can make throws on the run and has NFL arm strength. Good athlete, can get to the perimeter and escape trouble. Has some real high-level reps on his tape where he throws with the anticipation and velocity needed. Knows how to throw receivers open on the sideline with a back shoulder. Looks good in rhythm, has a solid base to him and quick feet to set and fire to his target.
cons: He will be 25 when he gets into the NFL, he took a mission trip before playing at BYU. Not the ideal size at 6’1 205, he’s on the small side. Doesn’t have the zip on the ball you would want from a project QB. Doesn’t step in his throws with pressure, scared of getting hit. Too many head scratching plays where he is just either way off accuracy wise or decision making. Get lazy sometime and drifts when he throws causing inaccurate passes.
take: Hall is a solid project QB a team should take a chance on. He’s already 25 but he’s got the arm talent and athleticism that is a hard to find together. He has moments where he looks like he could be in the top of the class so if he can be more consistent a team may find a late round gem.
RB Sean Tucker Syracuse 73
info: Tucker was one of the top RBs coming out of Owings Mills MD where he was also a track star winning the 100 and 200 m as a junior. He got looks from a few schools like Wisconsin and Syracuse and chose to stay closer to home and commit the Orange. His opportunity came early while many opt outs and injuries caused him to be bumped up the depth chart. He ran for 626 yards that true freshman year and put his name in the spotlight of potential NFL RBs. He solidified that thought by playing great in 2021, he ran for 1,515 with 6.1 YPC and 12 TDs while breaking 66 missed tackles and 4.11 YPC after contact. He was an All American after that year and was on the Doak Walker award radar heading in to 2022. It was a little disappointing of a 2022 season but he still played well, accounting for much of Syracuse’s total yards he ran for 1062 yards with 11 TDs but only averaged 2.79 Yards after contact.
pros: Well-built RB with good speed, 5'10 210 and has plenty of breakaway runs, once he gets into space he’s gone. Produced on a Syracuse team that didn't have much talent, the OL was awful. Has good power to run up the middle and grind for yards. Flashes some good body control on receptions out of the backfield. Good in the open field, a nice side step to go along with his great speed.
cons: Not the best out of the backfield, 13.7 drop percentage for his career. Doesn’t have the short area quickness to make a guy miss in a phone booth and accelerate through a hole. Likes to bounce to the outside a lot, granted his OL did no favors.
take: Tucker was the best skill player from Syracuse in years, his OL did him no favors but he flashed his extreme talent anyway. He’s a solid size to go along with great long speed which teams are going to like. He will never be a top guy in the NFL (he’s not breaking tackles left and right) but he can definitely be a good RB for many years.
RB Israel Abanikanda Pitt 73
info: 241 carries 1,426 yards 20 TDs.
pros: Young prospect, only 20 years old. Had an amazing senior season, ran for 1,400 yards and 20 TDs with a 90.6 PFF grade. Great speed, ran away from so many defenders last year. Can break arm tackles and smaller defenders tackles with adequate strength.
cons: Was a non-factor in the pass game, never blocked well and only caught 12 balls. Doesn’t have the great quickness and agility that a speed back would want. Not a great tackle breaker, he’s more of a maximize what you blocked for back.
take: Abanikanda made himself some money this year with a break out 1,400 yard season. He is a back that will show how good your OL is, if the hole is there he will take advantage of it with his speed. But, if you ask him to create by himself that’s not his game and will turn losses into gains.
RB Lew Nichols Central Michigan 73
info: 175 attempts 6 TD 69.5 RUN.
pros: Great 2021 season, 1,846 yards 16 TDs and a PFF grade of 84.8. Solid size at 5’11 222. Has excellent short area burst, can deliver a blow in 1 step. Good quickness and vision to find the hole.
cons: Massive drop off in 2022. Not very good out of the backfield. Lost a little speed in 2022 by gaining some weight.
take: Nichols was the Central Michigan offense in 2021, he put up impressive numbers. In 2022 he added some weight but kept his good feet a vision and added power. He’s a great RB build with good explosiveness but he doesn’t have the speed and pass catching ability that a number 1 back would want now a days. He should be a good RB2 in the league.
TE Brevyn Spann-Ford Minnesota 73
info: 42 receptions 497 yards 2 TDs.
pros: Big TE at 6’7 270, he is a plus in the run game. Great length, can pass block with the length he has and extend to catch any ball.
cons: 5th year player that took 3 years for him to contribute. Not a plus athlete, never going to be a top receiving threat.
take: Spann-Ford is a big run blocking TE that has some receiving upside to his game. He’s not the extra OL like some TE’s are but he can easily step in to be the TE2 and make an impact.
TE Tucker Kraft South Dakota St 73
info: 27 Receptions 348 yards 3 TDs.
pros: Perfect TE build at 6’5 255. Very good against FCS competition, easily shrugged off defenders. Solid hands and good catch radius.
cons: Got hurt week 1 against Iowa and missed 2 months. Played in the FCS against weaker competition. Drops may be a concern at 10% drop rate. Looked out of place at times blocking FBS talent. Not at plus athlete that will run by anyone.
take: Kraft was very good for South Dakota using his great size and strength to bully lower-level competition. It will be an adjustment to the NFL for sure but he has the ability to play in the league.
WR Cedric Tillman Tennessee 73
info: 37 receptions 417 yards 3 TDs.
pros: Good size, 6’3 215. Solid hands, 5% career drop rate. Good body control and making plays on the ball through contact.
cons: Injured for his final season for 6 weeks causing production to drop off. 1 out of 5 years he caught more than 40 balls. Not a good athlete, not quick and the speed is average.
take: Tillman had a great 4th season where he had over 1,000 yards after a down first 3 years. He came back for his 5th and final year to add on to his production but he got hurt. He’s a big bodied receiver that can make a play on the ball no matter who’s on him but he’s not that good athlete that will create separation.
LB Mikel Jones Syracuse 72
info: Jones was a surprise commit to Syracuse after attending IMG academy and earning a high 3 star recruit and getting offers from many top SEC schools. He immediately played as a true freshman getting 4 starts and 38 tackles. He started for the remainder of his career getting 4 INTs in 2020 and 70 tackles in 2021 along with an All ACC first team selection.
pros: Good in coverage, finds receivers in space well and reads designed screens well. Good patients and athleticism to close in fast.
cons: Not a big linebacker, weak side only.
take: 
OG Nick Broker Ole Miss 72
info: 3,323 career snaps 62 RBLK 72.8 PBLK 19 pressures.
pros: Played both OG and OT. Solid enough athlete to pull and do anything you ask of him. Good technician, always engaging the defenders chest and trying to drive them. Works hard in the run game, will run his feet to stay on the block.
cons: 32 inch arms, not a very long player. Never graded above 70, was never a dominate OL. His strength is an issue, he fits defenders well but can’t move them and can struggle anchoring. High level defenders can toy with him, he’s just not a good NFL athlete.
take: Broeker plays hard and is solid with his technique. He has physical limitations that will hinder the level of his play to a high end back up to low end starter at best.
OT Jaelyn Duncan Maryland 72
info: 2,631 career snaps 61.9 RBLK 67.6 PBLK 28 pressures.
pros: Solid tackle size at 6’6 320. Solid size, athleticism and strength combo. Solid hand usage, like to go outside in pass pro but he’s strong enough to do it.
cons: Never really dominated in his 5 years at Maryland. 3 worst games were by far the worst and against good competition. Some of the worst balance I’ve ever seen, constantly on the ground and lunging. Loves to hold, he was flagged over 10 times.
take: Duncan is 100% physical tools and almost no production currently. He’s not a total train wreck in the technique department but after 5 years with his ability you really want to see more than what he’s giving you. If he can figure it all out he could be a plus NFL starter.
OT Braeden Daniels Utah 72
info: 2,942 career snaps 65.6 RBLK 78.7 PBLK 15 pressures.
pros: Solid length, 33.5 inch arms and an 82.5 wing span. 2020/2021 88 and 89 PFF RBLK grades, graded well in 2021. Versatile, played LT LG and RT. He’s a good athlete that can mirror defenders and handle speed rushers. Good at keeping defenders away from him with his length.
cons: He’s very small at 6’4 297 he’s in the bottom 10% for weight. Took a step back in 2022 from an 84 to a 72 PFF grade when he moved to LT. Sloppy feet and inconsistent hands, will lower them and let guys in his chest and loses the hand fight a lot.
take: Daniels is a developmental tackle even though he has almost 3,000 career snaps. His feet need work as well as his sets and his hand fighting as well. The athlete is there though, he’s a solid lineman with good length he just needs coaching.
QB Stetson Bennett Georgia 72
info: 4,132 yards 27 TD 7 INT 68.1% 88.9 PASS 66.1 RUSH.
pros: Not a stranger to a big game, he won back to back national championship games. Improved every year and ended up with a 90 PFF grade in 2022. Has solid movement skills, can extend plays and find open receivers on the move. Good accuracy, can put the ball where it needs to be to protect receivers or throw them open. Doesn’t make many bad decisions, careful with the ball. Under rated tough runner, can be effective running. Throws the ball with good touch, can layer the ball in.
cons: Peaked in college, won 2 national championships and no way his luck continues. A small QB at 5’11 190 and he already is 25. Needs to throw from a better base more consistently, can slip or fade too much. The arm is only ok, he doesn’t have the power behind it of a top QB. It was easy a lot at Georgia with that much talent.
take: Bennett is going to be underrated his entire life, after being a walk on at Georgia and fighting for his spot he lead the Bulldogs to 2 national championships. He’s a good athlete with an average arm that just seems to make plays whenever is needed. He showed in 2022 he can make good decisions and deliver the ball with good timing and accuracy. He wont go in the top of the draft because physically he has no calling card but don’t be surprised if he comes in the league gets an opportunity and plays well as a starter.
RB Deuce Vaughn Kansas St 72
info: Vaughn was born in Fayetteville AR and moved to play HS football in Round Rock TX. He accumulated 5,472 all purpose yards to go along with 50 TDs in his career there. He had offers from many SEC schools but chose K State over them where he played as a true freshman and was named the Big 12 freshman of the year after getting 1,221 all purpose yards. His next season in 2021 was great, he had over a 91 PFF grade while rushing for over 1,500 yards and was All big 12 1st team. In 2022 he had a similar statistical year to make his mark as one of the best backs Kansas State has ever had.
pros: He's been a work horse for Kansas State, 3000 yards and over 500 carries in the last 2 years. Forced 106 missed tackles in the last 2 years with 27 TDs. Doesn't fumble often, only 2 career fumbles on 646 carries. Very good out of the backfield with a career 117 receptions and 1,275 yards. Great change of direction and quickness to his game, makes people completely whiff at times. Has break away speed and wont be caught by any LBs. Not afraid of contact, wont dance away from it.
cons: He's beyond small, you wont find a smaller back in the league at 5'6 175. Under an average of 3 yards after contact. Awful pass blocker, 21.3 is his highest PFF grade. Not going to get extra yards through contact. Probably wont be able to pass block.
take: Everything about Vaughn has to have the disclaimer of he’s so small. It’s hard to succeed in the NFL at his size but he can find a nice role out of the backfield in spread situations especially.
RB Chris Rodriguez Kentucky 72
info: 175 carries 904 yards 6 TDs.
pros: 2 grades over 90 for rushing. A career 6.2 YPC with 3,642 yards. Big well built back at 5’11 224. Packs a punch on initial contact, can easily run over defenders. Runs angry, arm tackles wont stop him and he’s not a fun back to bring down.
cons: Suspended for an unknown reason to start the 2022 season. Older prospect, this is his 5th year in college. Never a plus receiver, essentially a running back only. Can want to get too north and south sometimes, running straight into lineman. Not much quickness to his game, won’t make people whiff in space.
take: Rodriguez is an old school runner that would be a great back in the 80’s. He’s powerful has solid speed and put up numbers through out his career. He’s got the off field red flags and isn’t much of a pass catcher but that shouldn’t prevent him from finding a home in the NFL.
QB Tanner Morgan Minnesota 71
info: 1,382 yards 9 TD 5 INT 66% 86.5 PASS 78 RUN.
pros: His final year he had a 90.4 PFF grade. Career 9,449 yards and 5 years with starts. Amazing feet, best I’ve seen in the class. Throws with stellar anticipation. Accurate and precise, can put the ball anywhere. Has some mobility to his game.
cons: Got benched his senior year, not sure why but he was. He’s not a big QB at 6 foot 205. Career more TWP than BTT. His arm is below NFL standards.
take: I’m putting my stamp of approval on Morgan, he has some of my favorite film to watch. His technique is outstanding and he understands the game and anticipates at a high level. If he had an NFL average arm he would be a first round pick. He has great backup written all over him and that can be very valuable.
RB Keaton Mitchell East Carolina 71
info: 201 carries 1,452 yards 14 TDs.
pros: Back to back 1,000 yard seasons with a PFF rush grade if 93.9. Forced 75 missed tackles in 2022 while rushing for 7.2 YPA. Good change of direction, low center of gravity makes cutting easy for him. Explosive athlete, can accelerate and run past defenders.
cons: Not a very good pass protector, he’s only 5’9 183. Level of competition is a concern. No strength to his game, never going to be a physically dominate RB.
take: Mitchell is an electric back with solid contact balance and good athleticism. His biggest knocks are his size and competition level which are real concerns. He should be able to be a returner or maybe even find himself as a change of pace back in the league.
RB Tiyon Evans Louisville 71
info: 83 carries 518 yards 6 TDs 76.7 RUN.
pros: 22 missed tackles forced on 83 attempts. Good strong muscular build. Explosive athlete, can burst through the line well and keep his feet going. Solid speed, has the break away speed in the 2nd level.
cons: fumbled 3 times in 83 attempts. Why did he only get 164 college carries, he’s better than that. Injured in 2022 and missed his chance to show out.
take: If you were to watch Evans in a game he starts you wouldn’t believe that he never broke 100 carries. He’s the perfect build with a muscular frame and strong legs. He also is an explosive athlete with some speed and contact balance. I wouldn’t be surprised if he cleans up his fumbles if he becomes an impactful RB.
QB Chase Brice Appalachain St 70
info: 2,922 yards 27 TD 6 INT 74.9 PASS.
pros: Played for 3 teams in 5 years, he has experience. Good size, 6’2 237. Shows very good touch and accuracy down the field. Can play in and out of rhythm, good feet in the pocket and good arm talent off platform.
cons: Never played that well, his best years were as a backup at Clemson. Lack of college production and success.
take: Brice looked really good his last year at App State. He’s a Strong QB with some mobility and a solid arm. He can do everything you ask of him but he never really became the guy. His college career was him going from program to program and never being a top QB in the nation.
QB Aidan O’Connell Purdue 70
info: 3,483 yards 22 TD 13 INT 63.7% 67.4 PASS 52 RUN.
pros: Solid size, 6’3 212. Had an incredible 2021, 90.0 PFF pass grade with a 7.8% BTT. Has decent zip on the ball, can fire it in to tight windows if needed.
cons: Dropped off in 2022, regressed back to pre 2021. His feet don’t set up to the target too much causing inaccurate passes. Makes some awful turnovers that are as bad as they get. Not much of an athlete, more like the statue QB of past.
take: O’Connell showed in 2021 that he could be an NFL starter with an unbelievable amount of big time throws. He is a solid build that has an NFL arm to go along with it. He did struggle with turnovers and bad accuracy at times which may limit his to be a career backup.
QB Matthew McKay Elon 70
info: 2,710 yards 21 TD 4 INT 60.5% 87.2 PASS.
pros: Played at NC state before. Solid size and athlete combo, 6’4 212 and can run. Has effortless arm talent, a quick flick can be 55 yards.
cons: Only played well in the FCS. Accuracy underneath is questionable. His touch passes aren’t pretty. One read then scramble. Throws it toesy too much.
take: Mckay is a talented QB with a strong arm and effortless velocity. He’s also got size and athleticism to go with it. He’s not refined for sure, he’s got mechanical issues and isn’t a great processor. If he gets coached up he could play in the NFL.
RB SaRodorick Thompson Texas Tech 70
info: 138 attempts 682 yards 7 TDs 82.5 RUN.
pros: 5 years of solid production. Solid size and burst, 5’11 213 and has some shake to his game. He wants to get every yard he can, feet always moving to either make a defender miss or drive forward. Broke 42 tackles in 138 attempts in 2022.
cons: Never was the guys, highest yardage in a season is 763. Bone bruise at the end of 2022 in his ankle. Isn’t the fastest or the strongest back, will be a middling NFL athlete.
take: Thompson is a solid back that tics all the boxes, he’s big enough and athletic enough to play in the league. He runs hard and forces a lot of missed tackles and was top 20 in elusiveness rating. He was never the guy in college but he can certainly be a great 2 for a team.
RB Jordan Mims Fresno St 70
info: 260 carries 1,371 yards 18 TD 90.2 RUN.
pros: Hasn’t fumbled in 5 years, 500 straight carries with no fumbles. Good vision and patience, he finds the hole and sets blockers up well. Solid quickness, can cut well and make short area moves to find space.
cons: A tad undersized at 5’10 200. Old prospect, played his freshman year in 2017. Not much of a receiver, only 132 yards in 2022. Not the best tackle breaker, his size isn’t ideal for that. Not a top tier athlete, isn’t going to be showing off his speed and burst in the NFL.
take: Mims made some money by coming back to school, he racked up over 1000 yards and 18 TDs. He showed his ability to take advantage of his blocks and set them up to get every yard possible. Quickness is the physical attribute he will rely on and not strength or speed which isn’t ideal for a lead back. He is certainly good enough for the NFL and should make a roster.
QB Malik Cunningham Louisville 69
info: Cunningham was a 3 star recruit coming out of Park Crossing HS in Alabama where he drew intrest from a few top SEC teams befor deciding to go with Louisville. He redshirted in 2017 before getting 3 starts his red shirt freshman season in 2018 where he ran for more yards than he threw. He was the full time starter from 2019 on where he always put up some impressive numbers. between 2019 and 2021 he threw for 7,600 yards and 61 TDs and also added 2,500 rush yards as well. That 2021 season was truly impressive, he received a 91 PFF grade and passed for about 3000 yards and over 1000 rush yards. 2022 was supposed to be the year where he put himself in the top of the draft conversation but he fell short of that oly throwing for 1,567 yards and 8 TDs and 5 INTs.
pros: Running back like skills at the QB spot, on 108 attempts in 2021 he forced 51 missed tackles. Good at throwing on the run, pretty good when he escapes the pocket. Good base and throwing motion, does a good job in the pocket with his technique. Very shifty, can make LBs miss in space easily.
cons: Arm strength is mediocre, not going to look good on an NFL field. Pocket presence is not good, a lot of drifting and trying to create with his legs. Doesn't throw into windows well, not sure he trusts his arm.
take: Cunningham is a very good athlete and has put up a great season in college. But, he's a little inconsistent threw the air and doesn't have the arm to be a high end starter.
QB Jake Haener Fresno St 69
info: 2,900 yards 20 TD 3 INT 71.3% 86.2 PASS 70.2 RUN.
pros: Completed over 70 percent of his passes in 2022. Improved every year getting to an 87.9 PFF grade. Was very good in the senior bowl. Nice accuracy down the field especially on crossers. Good intangibles, coaches liked him and he’s tough.
cons: 6 foot 208, he’s not a big QB. 5th year senior that will be 24 and played at Fresno. Toesy when he throws, needs to work on that. Really bad under pressure throwing short routes, looks like he short arms it. Arm is middling for the NFL, not impressive velocity. Not much of an athlete, not going to add any thing in the run game.
take: Haener has backup written all over him, the physical ability is just not what you look for. He is accurate and smart though; he can run an offense as shown by the senior bowl. I can’t see him ever become a starter but a high end backup can be valuable.
QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson UCLA 69
info: 3,159 yards 27 TD 10 INT 69.3% 68.6 PASS 73.7 RUN.
pros: Has over 10,000 career pass yards, has been playing for a while. Very good athlete, he can add to the run game. Good throwing on the run and off platform, he can make accurate throws with no base. Great pocket movement, very quick.
cons: 5th year senior that is 6’1 191. Longish inefficient release. Puts the ball in harms way too many times, doesn’t respect safeties range.
take: Thompson-Robinson is a very experienced QB with some eye opening tools. He has a solid arm to pair with great athleticism. He’s on the smaller side and struggled with decision making which is not a good combo, but he could be a very good backup.
QB Fred Payton Mercer 69
info: 3,037 yards 32 TD 8 INT 67% 93.1 PASS.
pros: 93.1 Pass grade and didn’t throw a pick through week 6. Very accurate, he knows where to put the ball to put it out of harms way. Solid movement skills to get out of the pocket.
cons: Not the strongest arm, needs to have a clean base to throw from. Off platform accuracy isn’t there, too inaccurate.
take: Payton is a nice surprise, he’s a very solid QB with ok size and athleticism but great accuracy and IQ. If his arm were up to NFL standards he would be a mid round pick but it’s just not NFL average.
QB Lindsey Scott Incarnate Word 69
info: 4,681 yards 59 TD 8 INT 70% 92 PASS.
pros: His stats are wild, unbelievably good. 3 straight years grading above 88.5. Has a solid arm and is good in the quick game. Good athlete, can scramble to buy time and run the ball.
cons: 5’11, he’s a very short QB. Has a tendency to throw behind the receiver. Played his worst game in the Playoffs against the best comp, not seeing open guys. Struggled mostly over the middle of the field.
take: Scott was incredibly productive in 2022, he was arguably the best QB in CFB. He’s a good athlete with a solid arm and flashes of great accuracy. He’s just too short and played in the FCS so he can’t get drafted high. He struggles over the middle like one would expect for a sub 6 foot QB but he plays a little like Russell Wilson.
RB Khalan Laborn Marshall 69
info: 303 carries 1,535 yards 15 TD 84.4 RUN.
pros: Former 5 star with good size, 5’10 210. Good athlete, cuts hard and accelerates well. Runs very hard, trys to get every yard.
cons: Was dismissed from Florida State. Didn’t play for 2 years and only had one productive year. Bad vision, not patient and doesn’t see the blocks well. Not very balanced, doesn’t run through tackles well and can slip too much on cuts.
take: Laborn is a great athlete that runs hard every play. He showed against good competition he can’t run through tackles like you would like and his balance is mediocre. The former 5 star could make a roster though with his physical ability.
RB Christopher Brooks BYU 69
info: 129 attempts 820 yards 6 TD 82.1 RUN.
pros: Never fumbled in his career. 6’1 235, he’s a hoss. Higher Elusiveness rating than Jahmyr Gibbs. Runs behind his pads, will fight for every yard.
cons: Never cracked 1000 yards and wasn’t the lead dog. Not many receiving opportunities. Not impressive cutting, high center of gravity.
take: Brooks is a tank of a power back, at 6 foot 235 he can push a pile at the goal line. He’s not going to do anything else but be a power back but he’s good at it.
RB Jarveon Howard Alcorn St 69
info: 250 carries 1,239 yards 12 TD 77.1 RUN.
pros: 68 MTF in 2022. Got better every year and dominated the first year he got a shot. Runs hard with very good contact balance. Good burst, he explodes into contact and through the line.
cons: Couldn’t get on the field at Syracuse. Not a top tier athlete, he doesn’t have the great agility or top speed. Questionable vision, doesn’t look to set up blockers and give them time to set up.
take: Howard was a top back in the SWAC this year, getting 1,239 yards and 68 MTF. He’s a tackle breaker that runs angry and with good contact balance. He’s not the level of athlete to be drafted high or the vision to be an RB one, but he has a shot of making the roster as the 3rd back.
QB Holton Ahlers East Carolina 68
info: 3,699 yards 28 TD 5 INT 66.8% 82.6 PASS.
pros: A lot of experience, over 2000 drop backs and 13,866 yards. Good size, 6’3 237 he’s the prototypical build. Has an NFL can zip the ball in there and push it down the field. Can run a little bit, can run QB power.
cons: Never really dominated in his 5 years like you would like to see. Long slow release. Touch isn’t great, not accurate with touch throws. He’s a Lefty.
take: Ahlers is a big strong QB that has a solid arm. That’s enough to get you in the NFL but he also has a ton of experience that helps his prospects. He has the physical tools to play but he’s not refined, he needs to be more accurate and process better to be a solid NFL QB.
QB Max Duggan TCU 68
info: Duggan was the Gatorade player of the year in Iowa and was the top QB in the state of Iowa in 2018. He had interest from a lot of big time programs like ND and OSU but chose to go to up and coming TCU to lead the horned frogs to new heights. He did just that, he has always battled through injuries but started all 4 years of his career and always played solid football. He improved his grade from a 67 to 79 to 76 all the way to 85.6 as a senior. That final year he lead TCU to its first College football playoff and was named a Heisman Finalist for his efforts. He threw for 3,320 yards 30 TDs and 4 INTs along with over 500 yards rushing.
pros: Very willing runner, not scared of contact or to make a play. He’s got grit, went through a lot of medical problems but still kept pushing through. Decent arm/size combination, he wont look out of place on an NFL field. Can throw well from multiple arm angles and is a playmaker.
cons: Wasn’t the week 1 starter, never was the guy coming into the season. Not as accurate as you would like, misses too many open throws. A lot of big 12 plays where he has a lot of time and cant find open receivers early. Doesn’t trust his arm enough, multiple NFL open throws he passes up.
take: Duggan is a great college QB that you cant help but root for. He’s got the grit you look for and can will a team to victory if needed. He’s not very accurate though and his physical ability isn’t much to fall back on if you want him to be a franchise guy. He can stick around the NFL a while as a high end back up, he’s a version of Taylor Heinike.
QB Clayton Tune Houston 68
info: 4,065 yards 40 TD 10 INT 67.1% 91.3 PASS 72.9 RUN.
pros: Decent size at 6’2 216. Back-to-back 91 PFF grades with a career 11,973 passing yards. Production is there, he played well in the AAC and lead Houston to a lot of wins. Has the ability to move in the pocket and get out of sacks.
cons: Played at Houston, not the highest level competition and he had a star receiver in Tank Dell. Doesn’t have that strong of an arm, really has to put a lot behind a pass to get zip.
take: Tune had a great college career with many highlights in the 5 years. He just lacks the NFL ability, his arm is ok and so is his athleticism. He may be able to compete for a backup spot but being a starter is a reach.
QB Tommy Devito Illinois 68
info: 2,643 yards 15 TD 4 INT 69.4% 81.6 PASS
pros: Played at Syracuse. Has over 10 inch hands. Played well as soon as he left cuse. Has decent arm talent, best looking passer at Cuse in a while. Has the athleticism to play on the move and scramble.
cons: 6’1 206, not ideal size. Got benched for Garrett Shrader. Scared of getting hit, breaks down when pressure is there.
take: Devito is a solid QB but he doesn’t do anything great. He’s a middle of the road athlete with average size and arm strength with one full year starting. He’s got the tools to play in the league but he’s never going to be a plus QB in the league.
QB Sean Clifford Penn St 68
info: 2,822 yards 24 TD 7 INT 64.4% 80.1 PASS.
pros: 4 year starter at a top program and got better over the years. Solid size with a good quick release. Has some mobility to his game.
cons: Never broke out and became a top QB in the nation. He is older than me, he will be 25 day 1 in the NFL. Accuracy is just fine and he doesn’t have great power on his throws.
take: Clifford is an accomplished QB with a lot of experience. He isn’t great in one area though, he’s a solid athlete with a decent arm but not what you want in the NFL. He may be able to stick around as a backup with his high character but talent wise he’s not there.
QB James Blackman Arkansas St 68
info: Blackman was a high 3 star recruit coming out of Belle Glade FL as a 6'5 165 pound project. He commited to Florida State to sit and learn behind returning starter Deondre Francois. That plan didn't happen though, Francois went down with an injury in 2017 when the seminols were 2-5 and Blackman came in and as a true freshman led them to 6-6 throwing for 58%, 2229 yards and 19 TDs with 11 INTs. He returned to the bench in 2018 but in the one game he got to play against NC State he made the most of it. He received an 88 grade with 420 Yards and 4 TDs. That earned him the staring spot in 2019 where he was named captain but it was a disapointing season where he had more tournover worthy plays than big time throws. He ws the opening starter in 2020 before a young Joran Travis took the job and didn't let it go resulting in Blackman transfering to Arkansas State. He played well at Arkanasas State where he had a combined 30 BTT and only 11 TWP.
pros: Tall 6’5 athlete that has nearly 10,000 career yards. Good arm, he can throw off platform and zip the ball in platform.
cons: He’s a twig, at 6’5 hes under 200. Not the best at reading a field, missing a lot of open receivers for jump balls or check downs. Accuracy is only ok, not putting the ball on the money much.
take: Blackman had a great start to his career at Florida State before injuries took that away from him and forced him to transfer. He’s a 6’5 athlete with a good arm and you can’t teach that. I would love him in camp to see if he can develop.
QB Austin Aune North Texas 68
info: 3,551 yards 33 TD 15 INT 56.3% 71.4 PASS.
pros: Solid stats his final year. Can put some zip on it, solid arm that could work in the NFL. Rolled out on over half his drops.
cons: 56% completion and 15 INT in 2022. Touch and accuracy are not where they need to be.
take: Aune has a good arm and is a decent athlete. He has issues with accuracy giving the ball to the other team but if he can fix that he can be an NFL QB.
RB Percy Agyei-Obese James Madison 68
info: 159 attempts 905 yards 8 TD 80.0 RUN.
pros: Sick name. Never graded above 80 overall in 6 years. 6 foot 213, he’s a good size. Can do a little of everything, drop the shoulder, stiff arm, jump cut and run a little bit.
cons: 10 fumbles on 600 carries. Is already 24. Not an explosive athlete, cuts and acceleration are alright.
take: Agyei-Obese is an all around solid back. He’s a good size with decent athleticism and goo vision. He has no trump card to make him stick out in the NFL but he can run in the NFL.
RB Tavion Thomas Utah 68
info: 142 carries 676 yards 7 TDs.
pros: Back to back years of 85+ PFF rush grades and 28 TDs. Great size at 6’2 240, has the power back build. Always falling forward for extra yardage.
cons: 10 fumbles on 476 attempts. Took a step back in 2022, graded lower and rushed for 500 less yards. Not a good receiver out of the backfield, a career 50 receiving yards. Has no juice to his game, the speed and quickness are lacking.
take: Thomas is your prototypical big back that can play on short yardage plays. He’s not going to be a lead guy anywhere but can fill the power back role if needed.
RB Evan Hull Northwestern 68
info: 220 carries 914 yards 5 TDs.
pros: Student of the game, he has good vision with a solid feel for setting up defenders. Can produce out of the backfield, over 500 yards receiving. Good at running feet through contact, he will churn for extra yards.
cons: Poor pass blocking grades, 92% pass block rate. Not going to make people miss cleanly, will break a tackle but isn’t dangerous after that. Athleticism is lacking, the quickness and speed are barely NFL level.
take: Hull will not be impressing anyone with a highlight tape but he does a lot of things good enough to play in the NFL. He’s a back up through and through but he could be a nice 3rd back on a team.
RB Travis Dye USC 68
info: 146 attempts 889 yards 9 TD 82.6 RUN.
pros: A lot of experience, ran for nearly 4,000 yards in his career and had 734 as a true freshman. Was a leader of a resurgent USC team. Plays with no gloves, he’s a baller. Solid out of the backfield, willing to block and solid hands. Has pretty good acceleration and change of direction.
cons: 29 inch arms and 205 pounds, he’s small overall. 10 college fumbles in 666 attempts. Fractured his ankle in 2022. Not big fast or strong, that’s a bad combination. Doesn’t break many tackles.
take: Dye is a high character productive RB that played at top tier programs for the last 5 years. He is just not what an NFL RB looks like, he’s small and doesn’t have the blazing speed. He may find himself on the back of a roster but it will be tough.
RB Hunter Luepke North Dakota St 68
info: 97 attempts 628 yards 9 TD 81.8 RUN.
pros: had a 92 PFF grade in 2021, he was a do it all player. Big strong player that can do it all, lead block, run and catch. Has good feet for a FB, solid cuts and decent athlete.
cons: 2022 shoulder injury shortened his season. He’s a full back. He hasn’t blocked that much and has played a lower level of competition.
take: Luepke is a full back, most teams don’t have one and they are easy to find. He was a great runner in college and has receiving experience but again he’s a full back.
RB Xazavian Valladay Arizona St 68
info: 215 yards 1,192 yards 16 TD 86.4 RUN.
pros: 5 years of production and 4,465 career yards. Graded over 78 for last 4 years. Good zone runner, can press the line and cut well. Runs hard, will try to fall forward and get every yard.
cons: Never really dominated all 5 years, just solid production. 5’11 199, he’s on the smaller side. Not a string runner, arm tackles can get him and he wont run through contact well.
take: Valladay is an outside zone runner only, he isn’t meant for any other scheme. He has good vision and has the speed and cutting ability to be a good back in that system but that’s it. He’s small and not strong enough to run through contact so it will be difficult for him to stick on a roster.
RB Deshaun Fenwick Oregon St 68
info: 113 attempts 553 yards 7 TD 78.4 RUN.
pros: Good size at 6 foot 226. Consistent 70’s PFF grade. Runs very hard, fights for yards and wants to hit. Good at cutting and accelerating for a bigger back.
cons: Never broke 560 yards rushing in 5 years. Not a great athlete, wont be a burner. Can get too aggressive running instead of seeing blocks develop.
take: Fenwick is a solid back that runs at 100%. He can cut and run behind his pads well but he’s not a great athlete and he never produced much. He should battle for a 3rd RB spot.
RB Tucker Gregg Georgia St 68
info: 171 attempts 709 yards 12 TD 74.3 RUN.
pros: Solid build at 5’10 220. Good downhill runner, runs behind his pads and falls forward.
cons: Doesn’t make many guys miss, more of a straight forward runner.
take: Gregg doesn’t know how to not run someone over. He’s a one trick pony that is a no non sense runner that will pick up 1 more yard than you block for.
RB Isaiah Bowser UCF 68
info: 206 attempts 795 yards 16 TD 73.9 RUN.
pros: 6’1 225, good RB size. Strong runner, he runs behind his pads well. Solid vision, see’s what the offense is blocking. Decent at making the first guy miss at the line.
cons: Not a receiving threat, he had 14 receptions in 2022. Not a quick back, cuts and acceleration are lacking. Production was just ok, averaged a career 4.0 yards per carry. Pass pro is meh.
take: Bowser is a big back that runs with solid power. He is a short yardage guy that can serve a role for a team. He’s lacking the athleticism to be drafted but he can play in the NFL.
RB Nathaniel Peat Missouri 68
info: 101 attempts 443 yards 2 TD 72.3 RUN.
pros: Former Stanford player, probably smart. Runs hard and fights for yards. Good balance, runs through arm tackles. Decent cuts, low center of gravity.
cons: never ran over 450 yards in a season. Not fast, his acceleration and speed are mediocre. Not the best vision, can be too patient.
take: Peat is a former Stanford RB that runs very hard. He’s not a good athlete though so he will never be a starter but he could possibly be a nice 3rd RB.
RB Nasir Smith Central Connecticut St 68
info: 228 attempts 1,203 yards 13 TD 88.1 RUN.
pros: Good size at 5’10 220. Used to play for Auburn HS where he carried the worst team ever. Good burst and strength, will run through contact.
cons: Played against no names. Not the top end athlete, wont be sprinting away from anyone.
take: Smith has come a long way from Auburn HS in NY. He was the only good player on the team because of his good burst and hard running style. He’s not the best athlete though and didn’t play good competition so it will be interesting to see if he gets a shot.
RB Tyler Hoosman North Dakota 68
info: 175 attempts 1,020 yards 12 TD 89.2 RUN.
pros: Good vision and good patience. Good contact balance, doesn’t go down easy and has a good feel for avoiding defenders.
cons: Couldn’t be the starter at Norther Iowa. Played in the FCS against easy competition. Not a high end athlete, wont blow anyone away with speed.
take: Hoosman is a solid back but only had one good year. He see the field well and can avoid contact without being a top end athlete. He should get a shot at making a roster.
RB Jaleel McLaughlin Youngstown 68
info: 228 attempts 1,584 yards 13 TD 90.6 RUN.
pros: Back to back 1000+ years with 12+ TDs and nearly 7 YPC. 1 Fumble in 537 attempts. FCS All American that was ultra productive. Good vision and cutting ability, can get through a hole very well. Good athlete, speed and agility are there.
cons: Graded very poorly in pass blocking. 5’9 183 pounds, he’s extremely small.
take: McLaughlin was a very productive back at Youngstown over the last 2 years. He has very good athleticism and vision but he is just very small. He probably wont make a roster with that size but he’s worth a look.
RB Marcus Cooper Incarnate Word 68
info: 211 attempts 1,440 yards 11 TD 91.1 RUN.
pros: 91.1 RUN grade with nearly 7 YPC. Good speed and runs hard. Good vision and acceleration.
cons: 5’8 185, he’s a small back. No power, will get man handled. Dances too much in the backfield.
take: Cooper is another very small athletic productive FCS back. He should absolutely get a shot at the NFL but his size will limit him.
QB Tyson Bagent Shepherd 67
info: Played at a D2 school.
pros: Was good for a D2 QB, he won the D2 version of the Heisman. Has some solid escapability, has the quickness to move in the pocket well. Decent arm, can make NFL type throws.
cons: Not NFL ready right now, passes up a bunch of NFL open throws for check downs. Won’t be able to get away with the throws he makes on the move in the NFL. He’s not overly accurate, the precision isn’t there on his passes.
take: Bagent is a big time project, not many D2 guys even get a chance at the NFL. He has some ability but it will be an uphill climb for him to make a roster.
QB Todd Centeio James Madison 67
info: 2,682 yards 25 TD 5 INT 63.7% 87.8 PASS.
pros: Balled out in 2022 getting a 90.4 grade. Alright zip on the ball, not a noodle arm. A lot of experience in different offenses. Solid athlete, can move well and escape the pocket. Good feet in the pocket throws with a solid base.
cons: Old old, he’s been in college since 2017. Played for 3 teams and only was very good with one of them. He is short, max 6 foot. Got smoked in his one game in the power 5 4/15. Accuracy isn’t great, placement is ok and he misses too many throws.
take: Centio is a solid QB that played very well for James Madison last season. He’s a well built athlete that has a decent arm and a lot of experience. It took him 5 years to become that guy though and he still can struggle with accuracy so NFL starter is a reach. He should come in and compete for QB 3 in the NFL.
QB Tim Demorat Fordham 67
info: 4,885 yards 56 TDs 10 INT 64.8% 92.4 PASS
pros: Had an absolute absurd BTT at 10%. Big time performance in 2022, 92.5 PFF grade and over 50 TDs. Good size at 6’3 221.
cons: Only had one great year at Fordham. Arm strength is disappointing, no zip on the ball. Throwing to wide open players, not actually that accurate.
take: Demorat looks good until you watch him play. His stats are great as well as his measurables but the play is lacking. He got away with a lot of bad throws against bad competition and doesn’t make spectacular throws. He will have to battle for a practice squad spot.
QB Darren Grainger Georgia St 67
info: 2,428 yards 18 TD 7 INT 58.5% 73.5 PASS.
pros: Tall 6’4 athletic QB. He’s got a great arm, can sling it down the field.
cons: Not an efficient passer, a release isn’t that quick and isn’t a fast decision maker. Not accurate, low end of college passers.
take: Grainger is a tall strong armed athletic QB. Everything else needs a lot of work and it’s probably too much to work on to make the NFL.
RB Camerun Peoples Appalachian St 67
info: 100 carries 592 yards 5 TDs.
pros: 6’2 225, good size. Good combination of size and speed for special teams.
cons: 5th year RB with only 592 yards his 5th year. Runs way too upright. No quicks to his game, not an explosive athlete.
take: Peoples had a solid RB career at Appalachian State where he ran for 2,800 yards. He’s not a good enough runner to be a guy in the NFL but his size and speed give a little hope to him making an NFL roster.
RB Deneric Prince Tulsa 67
info: 127 attempts 734 yards 5 TD 72.8 RUN.
pros: Solid size at 6 foot 217. Used in the pass game a good amount. Somehow makes people miss.
cons: Never had a breakout year at Tulsa, the most yards he has ever had was 734. Is not explosive, cuts and acceleration are meh. Tall and runs high.
take: Prince was solid for tulsa, he had a few good games but nothing to write home about. He’s a solid RB that can play in the NFL but he can’t be an NFL starter.
RB Emari Demercado TCU 67
info: 121 attempts 681 yards 6 TD 77.5 RUN.
pros: 1 fumble in over 300 career attempts. 5’11 210, he’s a good build. Solid athlete, can get skinny and accelerate through the line.
cons: Was never the starter, and never ran for over 700 yards. Only really played for his last 2 years. Not much of a receiver, only 13 reception in 2022. Can’t run through contact, he’s got no power.
take: Demercado took a while to see the field, he’s not the strongest runner. He’s got some ability to accelerate through the line but he’s not going to be a reliable NFL back.
RB Hassan Hall Georgia Tech 67
info: 116 attempts 522 yards 1 TD 76.9 RUN.
pros: caught 28 balls in 2022, showed he can catch. Has pretty good speed and will run his feet.
cons: 6 foot sub 200, he’s a skinny back. Not a strong runner and his balance is questionable.
take: Hall is a solid speed back that has some nice runs in his tape but not enough of them.  He’s a slim build that will struggle with NFL physicality.
RB Jamyest Williams Georgia St 67
info: 85 attempts 459 yards 2 TD 76.4 RUN
pros: Quick and Fast. Sets up blocks well, good patience.
cons: 5’9 185, he’s very small. Played nobodies. No power to his game, gets taken down easy.
take: Williams was the lightning to Tucker Greggs thunder. They formed a good RB duo at Georgia State but his size will limit if he can play in the NFL.
RB Ellis Merriweather Massachusetts 67
info: 152 carries 611 yards 3 TD 67.9 RUN.
pros: Great size at 6’1 225. 2-time team captain. Solid 2021 campaign, 1,130 yards. Big back that will fall forward.
cons: Dropped off from 2021, way less efficient. Not much of a receiver, 7 receptions in 2022. Got killed against all the power 5 opponents. Not a tackle breaker, 20 TF on 152 attempts. Runs high and loses leverage.
take: Merriweather is a good sized back that was a staple of UMASS’s offense. He fights for extra yards and has solid power but that’s all his game is. Quickness, tackle breaking and speed aren’t there so it will be tough for him to play in the NFL. He has a shot to make a roster especially with his size but it’s a long shot.
RB Jacob Saylors East Tennessee 67
info: 227 carries 1,318 yards 15 TD 79.5 RUN.
pros: Tackle breaking machine, 67 MTF. Solid short area quickness, nice spin and quick cut. Killed Wofford.
cons: Not a good athlete. Smaller back that played at a lower competition level.
take: I want to see Saylors on an NFL field to see if he can replicate his college runs. He’s a tackle break at the FCS level but he’s an average athlete that’s undersized which is not a good thing for the NFL.
RB Marques DeShields Rhode Island 67
info: 184 attempts 1,173 yards 12 TD 79.9 RUN.
pros: 5 out of last 6 games over 100 yards. Solid speed, can break a long TD. Low center of gravity, can cut well.
cons: Didn’t even open the season as the starter. Dances a lot in the backfield to get nowhere. Not the biggest, 5’9 200.
take: DeShields played pretty well against his only FBS opponent and took over the offense at Rhode Island. He is an undersized back with some speed and agility and the production to go with it. The NFL will be a massive adjustment but he should get a training camp chance.
RB Ulonzo Gilliam UC Davis 67
info: 200 attempts 1,192 yards 13 TD 81 RUN.
pros: 5 years of production with 3 900+ seasons. Hasn’t fumbled in 2 years. 2 time team captain and All Big sky 1st team. 90 receptions over the last 2 years. Runs with good patience and is a solid athlete, see’s the play develop and has the quickness to hit the hole.
cons: 5’9 189 pounds, he’s a small back. Not strong and good at breaking tackles, he wont be creating on his own.
take: Gilliam is a good FCS back that produce for 5 years. He’s small but has good vision and athleticism but he’s just small. It will be a tough ask for him to make a team.
RB Carlos Washington Southeastern Louisiana 67
info: 148 attempts 725 yards 82.9 RUN.
pros: Good size, 5’11 220. He runs hard and with good power.
cons: Never ran over 800 yards. Not agile, his lateral agility and burst are only ok.
take: Washington didn’t have the most impressive college career playing at a low end school and not being a 1000 yard runner. He’s not the most athletic but he has a great build and runs hard. He has a chance to make it in the league.
RB Deonta McMahon McNeese 67
info: 190 attempts 1,415 yards 12 TD 90.4 RUN.
pros: 7.4 YPC, that’s an insane YPC. Good quickness and vision, can run between the tackles at his size.
cons: 5’9 185, he’s a small back. Not much strength. Not the blazing fast speed a 185 pounder needs.
take: McMahon was a dynamic RB for McNeese but he’s just small. You can see his quickness and agility are very good but the speed needs to be a different level at that size.
RB Trey Sneed Fordham 67
info: 198 attempts 1,140 yards 5 TD 91.5 RUN.
pros: 91.5 RUN grade with 58 MTF. Solid size, 5’11 215. Good ability to break tackles, solid contact balance.
cons: Has been playing since 2016 and didn’t play well until he was 25. Doesn’t have great power or athleticism.
take: Sneed has a great season 91.5 RUN grade and over 1,140 yards. He’s a solid back that does most things you would like an RB to do but he’s not special. He was a freshman in 2016 and just had his breakout season.
QB Kyle Vantrease Georgia Southern 66
info: 4,270 yards 25 TD 16 INT 61.6% 70.4 PASS.
pros: Played a lot of football, 1,300 career drop backs. Solid at attacking down the field, he has solid touch deep.
cons: Arm isn’t that good, not much power. Not much of a runner. Going to be 25, has been playing since 2017.
take: Vantrease is a solid QB that ran the Georgia State offense well last year. He had a lot of opportunities to throw in the offense and he made some nice throws down the field. He just isn’t physically impressive, his size, athleticism and arm are all slightly below average so it will be tough for him to stick in the league.
QB Trae Self Stephen F Austin 66
info: 2,556 yards 19 TD 4 INT 60.1% 81.1 PASS.
pros: Good runner and 6’4 200. 3 year starter that improved every year. OK arm, wont be that bad in the NFL.
cons: Career 60% completion percentage, not accurate.
take: Self is a tall athletic QB that has a solid arm but only played in the FCS. He has some good throws on tape but he’s not the most accurate which will make it tough for him if he gets a shot.
RB Dedrick Parson Hawaii 66
info: 187 attempts 830 yards 11 TD 83.2 RUSH.
pros: Solid grading at 88  and 83 in the last 2 years. Good build at 5’8 205. Good quick burst and cuts.
cons: Under 5 yards a carry and 3 fumbles in 2022. Power isn’t there, in the run game he can get tossed around and isn’t great in the pass game.
take: Parsons is a compact RB with solid quickness and burst. He’s small though and wont hold up great on an NFL field do to lack of speed and power. He will be a long shot to make it.
RB Ronald Awatt UTEP 66
info: 163 attempts 734 yards 2 TD 69.8 RUN
pros: Decent athlete, can run well for 6 foot 205. Has some agility to him, can cut and hit a hole.
cons: 6 receptions in 2022, not a receiving back. Not much of a tackle breaker, 26 MTF in 163 attempts.
take: Awatt was a solid 2 year starter for UTEP but physically he’s not very strong and can’t run through tackles well. He may make a training camp roster but it will be tough to make a 53.
RB Narii Gaither Gardener-Webb 66
info: 153 attempts 976 yards 7 TD 77.4 RUN.
pros: Back to back over 900 yard seasons. Good athlete, has some speed to his game as well as agility.
cons: Got injured on one run at costal Carolina. Listed at 180 which is small.
take: Gaither is a smaller speed and agility back that played well for 2 years for Gardener Webb. He’s small though and hasn’t seen real competition so it’s an uphill climb for his NFL chances.
RB Jacob Chisholm Dayton 66
info: 232 attempts 1,040 yards 13 TD 82 RUN.
pros: 3 straight 1000 yard seasons and hasn’t fumbled in the last 2 years. Consistent runner, same yards and MTF back to back years. Team captain 2 straight years. Solid receiving option, 600 yards and 9 TDs over last 2 years and had a 91.4 grade. Solid vision and quickness to hit the open hole.
cons: FCS RB, played against non-competitive competition. 5’9 191 pounds, small back. Not strong, will not run over anyone or be good through contact.
take: Chisholm is a small productive back that was good in the FCS. He’s has some solid quickness and vision but he’s just very small.
RB Julien Gums Nicholls 66
info: 196 attempts 873 yards 4 TD 83.8 RUN.
pros: Nichols all time leading rusher. Great size at 5’10 230.
cons: Not a receiving threat with only 10 catches in 2022. Never ran for over 900 yards and had a sub 5 YPC in 2022. Not a good athlete, not quick or fast.
take: Gums was a solid back for Nicholls and is a strong runner. He isn’t athletic though and probably can’t make the NFL.
RB Todd Sibley Albany 66
info: 152 attempts 986 yards 10 TD 85.2 RUN.
pros: Former Pitt RB, has FBS experience. Ran 6.5 YPC in 2022 and an 85 RUN grade. 5’9 220, solid RB build.
cons: Couldn’t make in in the FBS. 12 career receptions, not good. Not an athlete, can’t win a foot race or make quick moves.
take: Sibley is a well built RB that played pretty well in the FCS. He just isn’t a good athlete and could handle the FBS so the NFL is a stretch.
QB Ben Bryant Cincinnati 65
info: 2,744 yards 21 TD 7 INT 61.1% 84 PASS
pros: Solid size at 6’3 220. Never had a below 73 PFF grade.
cons: Only 2 years starting because of Desmond Ridder. Doesn’t have the arm strength to make tight window throws or the anticipation. Weird release, a funny arm action.
take: Bryant isn’t an NFL QB, he is too sloppy and doesn’t anticipate well enough. He’s probably not going to make a team.
QB Carter Bradley South Alabama 65
info: 3,335 yards 28 TD 12 INT 64.2% 76 PASS.
pros: Solid final year with 3000+ yards and 24 BTT. 6’3 212 isn’t a bad size.
cons: Couldn’t start for 4 years at Toledo.
take: Didn’t watch him but the resume isn’t that impressive.
QB Nkosi Perry FAU 65
info: 2,710 yards 25 TD 5 INT 58% 80.9 PASS.
pros: 6’4 athlete tha has 8000 career passing yards.
cons: He’s a twig, 6’4 and under 200. Sub 60 completion percentage, he’s not accurate. His arm is alright at best, not much zip.
take: Perry is 6’4 and a solid athlete. That’s all the good there is though, he’s not accurate and has a meh arm. He’s not going to make it.
QB Reece Udinski Richmond 65
info: 3,614 yards 29 TD 5 INT 72.5% 89.5 PASS.
pros: 6’4 220 and graded well in 2022. Accurate in the short game, doesn’t put the ball in harms way much.
cons: 4 unproductive years before breaking out. Not mobile, wont add anything with his legs. Arm is only ok, wont look good in the NFL. Doesn’t push the ball down the field.
take: Udinski looks great on paper, 6’4 220 with a 90.1 PFF grade. The tape isn’t that impressive though, he doesn’t push the ball down the field and isn’t physically gifted.
RB Tia Taua Nevada 65
info: 214 attempts 920 yards 11 TD 78.5 RUN.
pros: Didn’t fumble in the last 2 years. 5 straight years of being the number 1 back and 4000 career yards. Solid build at 5’9 215 pounds.
cons: Played at Nevada. 4.7 YPC in his career. Not an athlete, speed acceleration and power aren’t there.
take: Taua is a solid back that gets what you block for him. He’s not big strong or fast so I don’t think he will make a roster.
RB Jalen Holston Virginia Tech 65
info: 90 attempts 321 yards 5 TDs 67.9 RUN.
pros: He went to Virginia Tech. Solid size at 5’11 210.
cons: 6th year senior that has a career total od 1,200 yards. Sub 4 YPC.
take: Holston barely played, he’s a solid size and is an ok back. He’s not quick at all though and may not get a shot at the NFL.
RB Shaun Shivers Indiana 65
info: 144 attempts 587 yards 6 TD 72.2 RUN.
pros: Former SEC back behind Tank Bigsby. Spark plug of a runner, runs angry.
cons: 5’7 180, too small. Waited 5 years to become a starter and maxed out at 587 yards.
take: Shivers is a very small back that probably wont make it in the NFL. He runs hard as hell though and has had some success against power 5 teams.

info: 129 attempts 711 yards 9 TD 78.7 RUN.
pros: Team captain as a senior. 5’10 200 decent build.

info: 176 attempts 1,044 yards 8 TD 85.7 RUN.
pros: Good size, 6 foot 220 pounds. Improved every year ending in a 1k season.
cons: 2 career receptions, no experience. Played at Holy Cross, the competition was bad. Not an athlete.
take: Oliver is a strong runner that was good for Holy Cross at the end of the year. He is not an NFL athlete though so his chances of making a roster are slim.
QB Chris Reynolds Charlotte 64
info: 2,525 yards 22 TD 11 INT 63.6% 80.6 PASS.
pros: 5 year starter with over 10,000 pass yards. He runs the offense well and was a former walk on.
cons: Small QB, sub 6 foot and 200 pounds. Does not have an NFL arm. Inaccurate when he puts zip on the ball.
take: Reynolds did good for himself, from a walk on to the passing record leader at Charlotte he played well his entire college career. He just doesn’t have the size or arm to play in the NFL.

RB Elijah Dotson Norther Colorado 64
info: 204 attempts 935 yards 6 TD 67.6 RUN.
pros: Solid change of direction, cuts are crisp.
cons: Played in the FCS but wasn’t top of the line.
take: Didn’t watch much, seems like a decent athlete but you need to dominate FCS to play in the NFL.

info: 2,654 yards 22 TD 9 INT 61% 71.7 PASS
pros: Ok last year.
cons: Didn’t watch, more TWP than BTT.
