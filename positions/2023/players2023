QB Bryce Young Alabama 94
info: Young was a top 25 recruit of all time coming out of the power house HS Mater Dei where he lit up the competition leading to an offer from nearly ever power 5 team. Young Committed to Bama where he served as the backup to Mac Jones. After Mac left and was drafted in the first round Young picked up where he left off and dominated leading the Crimson Tide to an SEC championship vs the wildly talented Georgia team. He was awarded the Heisman trophy for the dominating season where he threw for 4,860 yards and 47 TDs and 7 INTs.
pros: Has the pedigree of a top level player, 5 star QB of Alabama and exceeded expectations for him. Keeps the ball out of harms way, only 2% TWP rate and 12 INTs in 931 attempts as well as 1 TWP when not pressured. Nothing looks much better than when he throws it on time and in rhythm, it’s poetry in motion. Has incredible arm talent, can make accurate throws on the run using not technique. Can throw at many different arm angles to get around defenders. Has enough athleticism to make plays on the run. Short quick release that is dangerous in the quick game. Many full field reads on his tape where he finds the 3rd receiver open. Moves well in the pocket, slips away from the defenders and finds open spaces in the pocket. He’s him, when he has the ball late and you need a score he gets it. Solid accuracy everywhere on the field.
cons: He’s very small, 5’10 sub 200 would make him a one of a kind QB at that size. Drifts way too much in the pocket, too many plays where he scrambles backwards that wont end well in the NFL. Would love to see more plays that he sets his feet and delivers a good ball with a follow through, too many just arm throws. Under pressure he never makes a good strong throw where he takes the contact and throws it normal. Doesn’t have a cannon that you want out of a top pick, not truly impressive arm strength.
take: Young is like Zach Wilson if Wilson had the pedigree and makeup of a top pick. Young has great arm talent and the intangibles that you look for in franchise QB. Sometimes you draft a guy for talent other times you draft him because he plays at a higher level than every one else, that’s exactly why you draft Young. He can be a franchise guy and lead a team to wins nearly all by himself.
QB Anthony Richardson Florida 90
info: Richardson was a 4 star recruit out of Gainesville FL and decided to commit to his hometown Gators.  After Penn State and Georgia offered him he opened his recruitment back up but stayed with Florida. He barely played his true freshman year behind Trask and Emory Jones but by his second year he got some reps after Jones disappointed. He came into the 2022 season as the starter for the Gators where he flashed while throwing for 2,500 yards and 17 TDs with 9 INTs while only throwing for 53%.
pros: Doesn’t take many sacks, under a 9.2 pressure to sack rate. Has elite arm strength and can put serious velocity on a ball when needed. Has arm talent to make off platform throws down the field. Has great size and athleticism for the Position, at 6’4 240 and the running skills to be a low-end RB he is a playmaker at QB. Moves around the pocket and avoids defenders very well.
cons: Takes forever to throw the ball, 3.18 average time to throw. Only completed 53% of his passes. Has some funky mechanics when throwing, his feet need a lot of work to settle down and be on platform. Not accurate now, has issues putting the ball where he wants it and it needs to be. Not helped by the garbage gators offense but never made great reads and focused more on the one target he had in mind. Not great in a west coast scheme, he’s not a game manager that will execute an offense well now.
take: Richardson is the closest thing to Josh Allen in a while and if he succeeds it will be a similar path. He has serious accuracy concerns which can be attributed to bad technique that is fixable, if he puts the work in he has the ability to be the next great QB in the NFL.
EDGE Will Anderson Alabama 89
info: Anderson was a 5-star recruit with offers to every major program coming out of Dutchtown HA in GA. He stepped onto campus ready to play earning a starting spot immediately and was a Freshman All-American. He put up 60 pressures with 8 sacks that year and graded out as a 79.1 as a true freshman in the SEC. He one upped himself his true sophomore year by leading the nation in pressures with 81 and 15 sacks grading out at an 89.9 and leading the Bama defense to the national championship game. He was a 1st team All-American and won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for his outstanding season.
pros: Excellent run defender, packs a punch on initial impact. Powerful hands, can stun blockers and rip through like nothing. High level athlete, can get off the ball unbelievably well and can time up snaps well. High motor player, good ant working in stunts and cleaning up in the run game.
cons: Not a very refined pass rusher, he doesn’t have many moves to beat tackles. His length is sub-par for a top level edge, he doesn’t stick out on the field just looking at him.
take: Anderson is a superb athlete with the strength and athleticism to dominate tackles with speed and power. He’s a great run defender as well so he can do it all. If he keeps working on new moves he could be an elite pass rusher in the NFL.
OT Peter Skoronski Northwestern 89
info: Skoronski was a solid 4 star recruit coming out of Park Ridge IL and was heavily recruited by Notre Dame but committed to Northwestern as an interior OL. He followed in his grandfather’s footsteps though, he played OT for the Packers and is in the Green Bay Packers hall of fame so he started as a true freshman at LT. He immediately played well earning a true Freshman All-American spot and a 2nd team all big 10. His sophomore year he continued his domination and was named to the first team all big 10 while grading at 83.8 and only allowing 97.4% allowed pressure rate. In 2022 his final year he came back with one goal in mind, dominate. That’s exactly what he did, he gave up on 6 total pressures all year with a 99.2% allowed pressure rate which is the best in the nation. He was named 2nd team All American and was the best pass protector in college football.
pros: One of the best college pass protectors, only gave up 6 total pressures on 474 pass blocking snaps. Amazing in pass pro, everything about it is nearly perfect. Feet are great, always balanced and always keeps his feet moving in the run game. Great hands, the placement is nearly perfect every time and his hands in pass pro are awesome. Good at picking up stunts and blitzes, keeps his eyes up and understands defensive stunts.
cons: Not the longest limbed tackle, gets pushed away by longer edge players. Doesn't have that next level athleticism, pop in run game is average and not a great mover in space.
take: Skoronski is one of the best pass protectors to come out of college recently, he does it with great technique and solid athleticism and strength. He's reminds me a lot of his former teammate Rashawn Slater, a great OL that lacks the power and length to be a top 5 pick. He's a great offensive lineman though who could immediately step in and start for any team in the NFL.
WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba Ohio St 89
info: Smith-Njigba was a 5 star coming out of Rockwall HS in TX where he put up absurd numbers and leaving the state of Texas to join Olave and Wilson in Ohio at OSU. in 2020 his true freshman season he played sparingly thanks to 3 top 15 picks but Jameson Williams left for Alabama the next year and he stepped into the slot role. His 2021 season was great, he caught 95 balls for 1,600 yards and 9 TDs with a 91.7 pff grade. Nothing was more impressive than what he did when he was the lone target in their bowl game where he put up 336 yards and 3 TDs. He let down OSU his senior year after he got hurt and only played 40 total snaps in 2022 and missed the CFP.
pros: Didn't have many contested catch snaps but he went 9/10 when he got them. Really good and natural hands, makes tough catches look simple. Really good out of breaks, sets up defenders well and accelerates out of the break. Great body control, can twist and readjust to any ball to make the catch.
cons: Missed so many games in 2022, he only had one season of actually playing. Played slot only with stars on the outside, a very easy situation. Doesn't have the best speed, wont run away from anyone. Never really had to deal with press.
take: Smith-Njigba would be a top 10 pick easily if he repeated hos 2021 performance, but he missed his senior season. He's got the Keenan Allen skill of getting open and making plays on the ball but is just lacking that top end speed. The ability to be a great number 1 receiver is there, but with the lack of pysical tools it is more of a risk than you would like.
QB CJ Stroud Ohio St 88
info: Stroud was a solid recruit coming out of Rancho Cucamonga CA where he was getting some looks before the Elite 11. After dominating at the Elite 11 his stock skyrocketed up to a high 4 star recruit and committed to Ohio State to back up 1st round pick Justin Fields. He didn't play in 2020 but in 2021 and 2022 he lead the Buckeyes to the CFP as well as being named a Heisman trophy finalist. In the OSU offense he put up amazing stats throwing to 1st round picks everywhere. Over the 2 years he threw for 7,760 yards 81 TDs and 12 INTs with a 92.2 and 84.1 PFF grade.
pros: Picked apart the middle of the field all year. Has the speed to be a running threat although he doesn’t use it. People around him say he has impressive character and is a great guy. Can really push the ball down the field, strong arm and good technique. Great down the field accuracy, puts the ball in very good spots. Works at a very high level in the pocket, looks like teaching tape on how to play QB.
cons: The Ohio State offense really helped out, open 1st round pick receivers everywhere. Awful under pressure, had a 34 PFF grade which is a massive drop from normal. Non rushing threat, he has broken one tackle in his entire career. Almost nothing to like out of structure, never makes a great play like that.
take: Stroud is very very reminiscent of the OSU QBs of the past. He looks great because all the open receivers and talented receivers. There’s no out of structure plays to fall back on but him in the pocket operating the OSU offense looks fantastic. He’s got the size, arm strength and production to be a great NFL QB but we need to see if it will translate.
WR Jordan Addison USC 87
info: Addison was a slightly built 4 star recruit out of Frederick MD where he decided to stay closer to home and enroll at Pitt with future 1st round pick Kenny Pickett. He made an immediate impact by catching 60 balls for 662 yards and was named a True Freshman All American. His Sophomore season blew that out of the water though, he caught 100 balls for 1,593 yards a 17 TDs which was enough to win him the Biletnikoff award. That season made him a hot commodity in the transfer portal where he teamed up with Caleb Williams to lead USC to a comeback season for the Trojans. He caught 59 balls for 875 yards and 8 TDs and was named 1st team All-PAC 12.
pros: Production alone is great, 3,130 career yards and a Biletnikoff award. Good speed, can burn DBs down the field. Fixed drop concerns in 2022, only dropped 2 balls and made a lot of nice catches. Quick in his routes, with the ball and off the line. Good balance, can get knocked around and stay on his feet. Good ball skills down the field, can track the ball well.
cons: Slim frame, at 180 pounds he can get pushed around with physicality and mess up timing. Would have liked to see more production in 2022 with Caleb Williams.
take: Addison is pretty close to Garrett Wilson coming out, both are undersized but so quick and good at the position it didn’t derail them. He can clearly produce while being the teams number 1 and I expect that to continue in the NFL.
RB Bijan Robinson Texas 86
info: Robinson was a HS All American where he won the Ed Doherty award (Top Arizona HS player) two years in a row. He had 114 TDs in high school which is a state record and those accolades lead to a high 5 star label with offers from many top programs. He chose Texas over all of them and immediately made an impact running for 700 yards with 8.1 YPC. His second year he took over the full time starting spot and ran for 1,127 yards with a 91.1 PFF run grade and 79 MTF. If that wasn't good enough he came back better than ever, He ran 1,575 yards 18 TDs with 4.17 yards after contact and 1004 MTF. All of that lead to a 96 run grade and a Doak walker award.
pros: Unreal short area quickness, could actually make a defender miss in a phone booth. Very good athlete, can run away in the open field and hit home runs. Good size and strength, can muscle his way through a defender when he needs to and always go forward. Great contact balance, very strong lower half that allows him to eat contact and keep going. Has great instincts when he has the ball, knows where defenders are and the best way to make them miss. Solid hands, shown the ability to make non trivial catches.
cons: Doesn’t have the best vision for and ability to set defenders up to be blocked. Only ok in pass pro, nothing special. Dances a little too much that can cause 4 yard gains to be 0.
take: Robinson is one of the most talented backs ever to enter the draft. There aren’t many flaws in his game, if anything he needs to learn how to slow down and be more decisive. He will immediately become a teams star RB and play very well from day 1 in the NFL
QB Will Levis Kentucky 84
info: Levis was an impressive recruit coming out of Xavier HS in Connecticut. He was the number 2 player coming out of Connecticut with a 4.0 GPA and offers to nearly every ACC and MAC school. He chose to go to the Big 10 and played for Penn State in 2018. He redshirted his first season and only got 2 starts over the next 2 years against Rutgers and Iowa. He decided to transfer because he didn’t want to sit behind Sean Clifford so he went to the SEC and chose Kentucky. He had a very good season both passing and rushing being one of Kentucky’s team captains. He put up 2,827 yards on a 66 completion percentage and 24 TDs 13 INTs along with 516 rushing yards. His Senior year was a bit of a disappointment, his stats dropped off a bit from his junior year but he went from a 90 to 68 PFF grade.
pros: Well built QB, 6’3 232 pounds, he clearly puts in the work in the weight room. Not a cookie cutter QB, has a funny personality behind him (see his bio and tik toks). Good runner, adds to the offenses run game. Has the NFL arm and accuracy, he’s not great but he’s NFL caliber. Can make some really nice throws on the run, good athlete that can play out of structure. Solid arm strength, ball comes off the hand easy and can launch it with little effort. Great at hitting a stationary target, can get screens out and run a quick hitting offense.
cons: Will be 24 by the time he starts a game in the NFL. Half of his production are just screen passes and designed sweeps by the offense. Inconsistent with finding open receivers over the middle, looks to the perimeter a lot and can get stuck on one player. Struggles with pressure, passing grade drops to 51 under pressure and 65 when blitzed (2021). Doesn’t make many of the wow throws down the field and over the top of defenses. When he leaves the pocket, he will leave to the wrong side or just not execute a scramble well. Not very accurate, throws it high to open receivers and doesn’t throw on platform.
take: Levis has everything physically you are looking for in an NFL QB, he’s 6’3 230 of very good weight and has the arm to play in the NFL. He is a good runner who can make the throws need from him, but he’s not a fully developed QB by any means. He was protected a little by the Kentucky offense and needs to be more consistent with his ball placement and decision making.
TE Michael Mayer Notre Dame 82
info: Mayer was the number 2 TE recruit and the Gatorade Kentucky player of the year. He had all the schools offering him so he decided to go to the TE factory ND. He immediately flashed as a top TE along side Tommy Tremble. His first year he caught 42 balls for 450 yards and solidified himself as NDs next great TE. He backed it up the next 2 years catching over 65 balls and 800 yards each year with a PFF grade of 92.5 in 2022 where he was named an All American.
pros: True junior at 6’4 250 with a 90+ PFF grade and an All American. Great run blocker, very willing and strong at the point of attack. Strong hands, can catch a ball while being hit by an LB.
cons: Not the modern day 4.4 blazing fast TE that can play WR as well.
take: Mayer will be at least a solid starting TE for an NFL team that is his floor. He’s a big strong TE that has great hands and an ability to get open. If he can just get a little more athleticism he can be a top TE in the NFL.
WR Rashee Rice SMU 82
info: 96 receptions 1,344 yards 10 TDs.
pros: 6’3 205, has a good build for the position. Amazing at adjusting to the ball mid air and winning 50/50. Good speed for his size, can run away from defenders. Good with the ball in his hands, can make defenders miss easily. Was the number one guy his final year and got better every year.
cons: Played at SMU so not the best competition he went against. Didn’t see many advanced routes or technique, usually won on simple go’s or hitches and him being more physical.
take: Rice developed into a star for SMU in 2022, doubling his production from the previous year. He played against weaker competition that you would have liked to see but he’s such a physically gifted receiver that he will not be out of place in the NFL. If he can continue to progress he will be a star in the NFL.
TE Dalton Kincaid Utah 81
info: 70 receptions 890 yards 8 TDs.
pros: 91.7 PFF receiving grade in 2022, top TE in the country. 1.6% drop percentage, great hands. Good athlete that can use his speed and strength after the catch. Great ball skills, very natural and strong hands. Good routes, knows how to sit in zone and create separation.
cons: More of a slot TE than an inline blocking TE, he can get tossed around while blocking. Was a 5th year player and still not a good blocker.
take: Kincaid is an interesting evaluation; he didn’t start playing football until 2017 but is a natural at it. He has the ability to be one of the best receiving TE’s in the league with his solid athleticism and great hands. He’s not your old school TE that can block inline but if he can work on that and continue to develop, he will be a top 5 TE in the NFL.
WR Josh Downs North Carolina 81
info: Downs was a 4 star recruit out of Suwanee GA where he was an All State player as well as a triple jump and long jump star. He committed to North Carolina to play with Sam Howell and learn behind Dyamni Brown. After Brown went to the NFL Downs stepped up and became the teams number 1 catching 101 balls for 1,335 yards and solidified himself as one of the nations top WRs. He came back in 2022 and caught 94 yards for 1,029 yards and 11 TDs which was good enough to be an All American.
pros: Back to back 1,000 yard seasons with 195 receptions over the 2 years. Fixed drop issue in 2022 only dropping 3% of his targets. Top tier ball skills, can rise up over defenders to make a play. Good athlete, has great speed and can make plays with the ball in his hands.
cons: 5’10 175, a very small build for a receiver. Not the quick and twitch elite level you want for a guy his size. Almost exclusively worked from the slot.
take: Downs is going to be helped out by how well Jahan Dotson played in 2022. They have similar skill sets with solid hands good speed and being undersized. He should be able to step into a teams slot receiver role and play immediately.
WR Quentin Johnston TCU 80
info: Johnston was a high 4 star recruit coming out of Temple HS in TX where he originally committed to Texas. He ultimately decided to go to TCU as one of the highest WR recruits they ever got. His first season there he showed off some impressive deep ball skills racking up 487 yards and 22.1 YPC. In 2021 as a true sophomore he showed his big play ability again with spectacular catches and 604 receiving yards. He really broke out in 2022 where he got 1,067 receiving yards and was named 1st team big 12 and lead TCU to the national championship game.
pros: Great size at 6’4 215 and is 21 as a true junior. He is a walking big play, averaged 18.8 YPC over his career. Great with the ball in his hands, he broke 19 tackles in 2022. Physical freak, can fly at his size, runs past CBs easily. Strong with the ball, can stick a foot in the ground and shake off defenders.
cons: May be the next Kevin White, game may not translate. For a guy his size he only was at a 40% career contested catch rate. Had a 10% drop rate which for a top receiver is a little high. Not impressive out of breaks, will not be creating separation at the stem. Agility and twitch are not apart of his game, he moves a little slow when trying to make people miss
take: null
QB Hendon Hooker Tennessee 79
info: Hooker was a 4 star recruit coming out of the DMV area with offers to nearly all the schools in area. He chose to go to the best of the schools Virginia Tech where he redshirted and then took over the staring spot a few weeks into his freshman season. He transferred to Tennessee in 2021 and took the starting spot from highly thought of QB Joe Milton and was great for the Vols. His 2021 season was fantastic and that continued into his senior year where he was in the Heisman running until his ACL non-contact injury week 12 against South Carolina. He finished his Tennessee career with 6,000 yard 58 TDs with only 5 INTs and a win over Alabama which was the first if the decade for the Vols.
pros: Doesn’t put the ball in harms way, under 2% Turnover worthy play rate in his final 2 years. Good mobility, can add to the run game as a QB as well as escape the pocket and get yards with his legs. Good quick release with good feet on almost all of his throws. Great short accuracy, screens and quick game throws are nearly perfect all the time. Put up the stats and wins in the SEC.
cons: 24 years old, one of the older prospects you will see. Doesn’t have the top-level arm talent where he can make off platform and deep throws down the sideline as well as a top level QB can. Would like to see more anticipatory throws, likes to see it open more than throw it open. Not the most precise passer when adding extra zip to the ball, can sail on him from time to time.
take: Hooker has the makeup of a top quarterback prospect, he’s a great decision make, a winner and has no big weaknesses to his game. The only issue with him as a prospect is his age and lack of trump card. He’s a good runner and has a solid NFL arm but he doesn’t have the wow plays to go at the top of the draft.
QB Tanner Mckee Stanford 79
info: Mckee was a 4 star recruit coming out of Centennial CA but before enrolling at Stanford he took a 2 year LDS mission in Brazil. He didn't play over Davis Mills in 2020 but he got the stating spot in 2021 and played solid with a 69 PFF grade and 2,325 yards and 15 TDs with 7 INTs.  His 2022 was similar but he did improve his grade to a 75 with 3,000 yards and 13 TDs and 8 INTs as well as being a team captain.
pros: Keeps the ball out of harms way well, only a 1.5% TWP. Good height, 6’6 can easily see over the line. Makes some great NFL throws with touch down the sideline. Solid arm strength and accuracy, probably would dominate at OSU. Had to deal with a terrible team around him, played well for circumstances.
cons: Production was meh, under 3000 yards and only 13 TDs. Takes a lot of sacks, a little uncoordinated looking. Long release, takes a little to long for the ball to come out of the hand. Plays with a narrow base a lot, he needs to be able to quickly release the ball with all the sacks he takes. Doesn’t extend plays well and make them by himself.
take: Mckee is an intriguing prospect, he is a big strong armed accurate QB with good arm strength. He’s a little like Daniel Jones which isn’t the prototype QB you look for anymore.
RB Roschon Johnson Texas 77
info: 94 carries 545 yards and 5 TDs
pros: 4 star dual threat QB recruit, made the switch and was immediately a natural runner. Only one fumble in his career and never had a rush grade below 82. PFF had him as the most elusive back in NCAA. Not a fun guy to tackle, caused 46 missed tackles on 94 attempts. Powerful runner, at 6’2 220 he runs through defenders and has a lethal stiff arm. Has more shake in his game then expected, a few hurdles and noce jump cuts on his tape.
cons: Not much of a receiver, 5 drops and 56 reception in his career. Never ran for over 650 yards, he was never the starter. Not a top end athlete that will accelerate out of his cuts like the best do. Missing the top end speed to hit the home runs in space.
take: Johnson has been 2nd fiddle his entire career which is absurd because he may be the 2nd best RB in this class. If it wasn’t for a once in a decade talent like Robinson he would have been the talk of college football. The 6’2 220 pounder has all the makings of a star RB and should be coveted highly in the draft.
RB Zach Charbonnet UCLA 77
info: Charbonnet was a top 50 recruit coming out of Oaks Christian in Westlake Village CA. He committed to Michigan where he flashed before leaving when Blake Corum came into town with Hassan Haskins. He transferred to UCLA where he was their number one back and ran for over 1000 yards back to back years and 90 PFF grades. He finished his career as a first team all Big 12 RB and a top RB in the nation.
pros: Breaks tackles at a high level forcing 121 missed tackles in his 2 years as a starter. Prototypical back, he's 6'1 220 and is a good athlete that can play on all 3 downs. 2 fumbles in 566 career attempts. Production is outstanding, in 2021 he ran for 1,358 Yards 7.0 YPC and 14 TDs. Surprising wiggle for a big back like himself, can shake DBs in the open field. He has a good feel for breaking tackles in every way. Strong at the point of contact, willing to get north south for the extra yardage. Solid in pass pro, can get hands on and stun defenders.
cons: Had to transfer to the PAC-12 to become a star. Not fluid out of the backfield, doesn’t scare any defense. Doesn’t have the athleticism that you look for in a top back.
take: Charbonnet is the prototypical work horse back, he doesn’t need to come off the field because he does it all. He’s a big back that can play on 3rd down, make the right reads and break tackles. The only thing he’s missing is the next level athleticism.
RB Jahmyr Gibbs Alabama 77
info: Gibbs was a 3 star coming out of Dalton GA initially before leading the state in rushing with 2,554 rushing yards an 40 TDs as a senior. He got bumped up to a 4 start and got offers from the SEC power houses but stayed commited to Georgia Tech. For some reason he was a rotation piece for GT in his first 2 years rushing for a combined 1,200 yards and 8 TDS before transfering to Bama where he was their lead back.  He iwas an impact player for Bama and ran for over 920 yards and 7 TDs as a true junior with 0 fumbles to go with it.
pros: Home run hitter at RB, with a 6.2 YPC and 52.5% of his yards coming on break away runs he is dangerous to take any carry to the house.  He's a solid receiver, with an 82.3 receiving grade and only 2 career drops he can be dangerous out of the backfield. Runs crisp routes, is a problem when he has an option route against a LB. Elite athlete at RB, great speed to go along with being twitchy. Breaks 1 on 1 open field tackles easily.
cons: Struggled in pass pro at bama receiving a 24 PFF grade in 2022. Doesn’t have the best running style, a lot of big plays or a short gain. Isn’t patient and not decisive, he doesn’t set up blockers well and hit holes with conviction. Likes to bounce to the outside too often.
take: null
WR Marvin Mims Oklahoma 77
info: 54 receptions 1,082 yards 6 TDs.
pros: 19.5 Yards per catch, he’s a solid deep threat. 89 PFF receiving grade as a true freshman. Good athlete, very fluid in space and can punt return. Good with the ball, slippery to tackle, guys slide right off him even at 185. Great ball skills, made some unreal catches. True junior that produced every year at OK.
cons: 5’11 184, would like to see him add size. Played in a OK system where there is nothing but space to deal with.
take: Mims was a stud recruit breaking Texas state records in high school and immediately made an impact in college. He has the athleticism and ball skills that are going to translate to the next level. He’s on the smaller side though which may limit him as a number 2 option, but he has the ability to be a good NFL WR.
CB Garrett Williams Syracuse 76
info: Williams was a lightly recruited corner out of Hickory Ridge in Harrisburg NC. He committed to Syracuse where he played on special teams his 2019 season. He then took over across from Melifwanu to form a top tier secondary and was named to the Freshman All American team by the Athletic. He had a “down” 2nd season where he was an All-ACC HM allowing 33 receptions and 380 yards.
pros: Solid size, 6 foot 190 and looks the part. Breaks on screens and flat routes well.
cons: 
take: 
RB Tank Bigsby Auburn 76
info: Bigsby has never flown under the radar, as a high 4 star recruit, he had offers from everywhere including his first offer from Bama as a Sophomore. He went to school in LaGrange GA where he rushed for over 2,200 yards but didn't go to his hometown Georgia Bulldogs, he committed to Auburn where he immediately saw the field. He rushed for 834 yards and was named the SEC Freshman of the year. He came back as the full-time starter in 2021 where he got 224 carries and rushed for 1,100 yards and 10 TDs. His final year in 2022 was by far the most impressive he ran for 976 yards but a whopping 700 of them came after contact. He forced 60 missed tackles and averaged 4.16 yards after contact.
pros: Stepped up as a junior, forcing 60 missed tackles and had 740 yards after contact he was Auburns rushing attack. All around back that has good speed the ability to change directions well and enough power to fall forward. Has breakaway speed once he’s in the open field he can keep his distance from defenders. Solid contact balance, arm tackles look like they don’t affect him. Shown every year that he can run in the SEC at a high level.
cons: Fumbled 4 times in 2021, he cleaned it up in 2022 but still concerning. Not much receiving experience out of the backfield. Not the best back at setting up defenders to be blocked or taken out of the play. Not elite at any one thing, doesn’t have the elite speed/quickness or strength. Runs high which loses him a lot of power.
take: Bigsby is a very good running back with the track record to prove it. He has all the tools to be a good RB in the NFL he’s just lacking a selling point to get a team really excited. If he can develop his receiving/blocking into a strength he will be a great all around 3 down back.
RB Dewayne Mcbride UAB 76
info: Mcbride was a low 3 star recruit out of Starke FL and had very little interest so he went to UAB. He was a playmaker his true freshman year averaging 0.3 yards per carry on 47 attempts which lead him to be the starter in 2021. He ran for 1,366 and 13 TDs and had 78 forced missed tackles. 2022 blew that out of the water when he ran 1,702 yards 19 TDs and had a 94.1 PFF grade. He was named conference USA player of the year and solidified himself as one of the best backs in college football.
pros: Never had below a 90 PFF run grade in his 3 years. Had a career 7.2 YPC with 4.93 yards after contact and 175 forced missed tackles. Well built back with solid athleticism, he’s 5-11 215 and is a pretty good athlete that will meet all the thresholds. Amazing contact balance, spins out of sure tackles and keeps the feet moving at all times. Very strong, can squat 550 and bench 385.
cons: Fumbling could be an issue, 9 fumbles on 484 carries. Did all his work against a lower level of competition, probably wont be as successful at breaking tackles against higher level competition. Not a twitched up runner, wont shake anyone or accelerate that well.
take: Mcbride was incredible against UAB’s competition, he is a very strong back that can break tackles and do everything else pretty well. He’s not the best athlete at the position though, the speed acceleration and agility are all ok but isn’t something to get excited about. It is very easy to project Mcbride to be a starting RB at the next level given his ability to run between the tackles and make people miss.
RB Zach Evans Ole Miss 76
info: Evans was an absolute star coming out of North Shore in TX where he and Bijan were RBs 1 and 2 coming out of HS. He led his team to back to back 6A division 1 state championships while rushing for over 10 YPC. As a sophomore in HS the offers started to roll in, he got an offer from LSU and many other schools before ultimately deciding to go to TCU. He was a big play waiting to happen at TCU, he wasn't the starter but he was averaging over 7 YPC and forcing missed tackles left and right. He transferred to Ole Miss and became their starter along side Quinshon Judkins and had a solid season with 930 yards 6.5YPC and 9 TDs.
pros: Talented back that was always highly thought of, even when he was at TCU everyone knew he was an RB1 talent. Great speed and power combo, will run you over and then past pursuing defenders. Runs low to the ground, great leverage when driving forward in piles. Loves getting north and south, isn’t afraid to hit the crease and grind for extra yards. Very strong lower half, easily slips arm tackles as well and run through people.
cons: Too many times the ball is on the ground, he dropped 5 out of 30 balls and fumbles 3 times in 2021. Was not a good pass protector grading at a 29.6 PFF grade. Never was the lead back, always sharing the roll and never being the guy. Never did much outside of run it, not many receiving opportunities or pass pro.
take: Evans is a no nonsense RB, usually you think of bigger backs like that but at 6 foot 215 he packs a punch and will run through you. He’s an Zeke Elliot type runner but a big unknown of his game is the pass pro and receiving ability.
TE Sam Laporta Iowa 76
info: 58 receptions 648 yards 1 TD.
pros: Good with the ball in his hands, 20 missed tackles forced. Good athlete, mover very well for a TE and can run WR routes. Iowa TE, not a stranger to blocking inline.
cons: Drops can be a concern for him. Doesn’t have the strength to be a good run blocker, they had him as a big slot a lot.
take: Laporta probably isn’t the next George Kittle just because he’s an Iowa TE. He’s a good athlete that’s a little undersized which hurts his run blocking. He is similar to Kittle in the fact that he’s good with the ball in his hands but he will need to get stronger to become a good NFL TE.
WR Zay Flowers Boston College 76
info: 78 receptions 1,077 yards 12 TDs.
pros: Put up 3,000 career yards and 29 TDs. Makes some nice plays on the ball down the field, can adjust well. Shifty and fast, with space he can be electric.
cons: 5’10 170, he’s a very small receiver. Drops are an issue at 10.8% career drop rate. Haven’t seen him beat press too much, may be a slot only.
take: Flowers is another small explosive receiver that has good athleticism but the size may limit him. He’s very good with the ball in his hands and can make plays down the field so that should make him a viable receiver in the NFL. Its to be determined if he has the ability to translate to the NFL but with his athleticism its worth a shot.
WR Xavier Hutchinson Iowa St 76
info: 107 receptions 1,171 yards 6 TDs
pros: good production catching over 100 balls in 2022 with an 89.4 receiving grade. Good hands, only a 4.9% career drop rate. Good routes/releases, can get off press and create separation initially. Long limbed, 6’3 and can extend to make plays on the ball. Great ball skills, does a great job reacting to the throw and getting in position to make a catch.
cons: Not very fast, isn’t threatening the defense vertically. Not quick out of breaks, he wont shake any DBs and break away from them.
take: Hutchinson was a big part of Iowa States offense, when they needed a 1st down he was their guy. He is a reliable big framed receiver that can make plays on the ball. He’s lacking that next gear though, he wont run past anyone or make anyone fear his athleticism.
RB Kenny Mcintosh Georgia 75
info: 2022 stats: 151 carries 824 yards 10 TDs.
pros: 45 missed tackles forced on 151 carries. Very good out of the backfield, 92 and 86 PFF Rec grades in 2021 and 2022 with a career 75 receptions for 865 yards. Amazing hands, can track and pluck a ball out of the air down the field and also can run nice routes. Runs with good pad level even though he’s on the taller side. Pretty elusive, can run through contact and has a good feel for side stepping tackles.
cons: Never was the work horse back, always being the second guy or sharing the backfield. He doesn’t have the juice that you want in an RB, he isn’t great at accelerating or changing direction.
take: Mcintosh’s calling card is his receiving ability, he clearly has the talent to be a solid NFL RB but his work out of the backfield is what he’s special at. He’s lacking the short area quickness that you want to see in an RB but he does everything else at a high level.
RB Kendre Miller TCU 75
info: 224 carries 1,399 yards 17 TDs.
pros: Young prospect as a true junior, will be 20 when drafted. Ran for 1,400 yards and an 88.5 PFF grade in 2022. Solid size at 6’0 220. 70 missed tackles forced in 2022. He’s a jack of all trades, he can run past slower defenders and lower the shoulder to get extra yards. Good contact balance and has a good feel for making guys miss. Sets up blockers well with good patients and sees the blocks develop well before making his cut.
cons: Not much of a 3rd down back, low pass block grades and 16 receptions in 2022. One year of being the teams lead back and 6 fumbles in 361 attempts. Isn’t a top end athlete and doesn’t have overwhelming power. Can be a little indecisive at times, can get caught waiting for an opening rather than taking what he can get.
take: Miller was a key piece of TCU’s run to the national championship. He was a great runner for them with the size and ability to break big TD runs and get the extra yards when needed. He’s not the most explosive back but he’s already so good at such a young age he should be a contributing to an NFL team now and for many years.
TE Darnell Washington Georgia 75
info: 28 receptions 454 yards 2 TDs.
pros: He sticks out on a field of SEC players by towering over everyone, he’s 6’7 270. True junior who player all 3 years with above a 68 PFF grade. Almost like having an extra OL, 81 run block grade. Solid as a check down receiver, wont just be an extra OL.
cons: Never was a volume TE receiver, 45 career receptions. Will never be a receiving threat, he’s just a guy as a receiver.
take: Washington has his clear strength and that’s run blocking, he’s a massive TE with the ability to contribute to the pass game. He’s not going to be an impact receiving threat ever but he should be able to easily contribute to a team.
RB Eric Gray Oklahoma 74
info: 212 carries 1,374 yards and 11 TDs.
pros: Rushing grade of 92.4 as a senior. Very elusive runner, good contact balance for size and bounces off DB’s. Can cut on a dime and completely throw off defenders angles. Has the speed and quickness to kill people in open space.
cons: Not a good pass blocker, struggled all 4 years. Didn’t run against many loaded boxes, Oklahoma’s offense was very spread out. Not a strong runner, won’t be running through many tackles. One year of being the starter and was 23 by the time he broke out.
take: Gray has some great highlights where he can make defenders look silly. He’s got great athleticism and moves very well in space. He’s not the most physically imposing back so he won’t be great all 3 downs but he can make plays in space that’s for sure.
RB Mohamed Ibrahim Minnesota 74
info: Ibrahim was a 3 star recruit coming out of Baltimore MD where he had a good career before committing to Minnesota. He redshirted in 2017 and in 2018 became the Minnesota Gophers 2nd leading rusher for a freshman behind Darrell Thompson. in 2019 for some reason he got less carries before having another 1000 yard season in 2020. He came back in 2021 ready to go absolutely gashing Ohio state for 160 and 2 TDs in 3 Quarters before going out for the season with an ankle injury. That led him to come back and only break Minnesota’s all time rushing record in his last bowl game against Syracuse.
pros: Production is great, 3 1,000 yard seasons and was consistent around 5.4 YPC. Over 2,200 yards after contact with 70 forced missed tackles. He’s a Damion Pierce light, absolute menace with the ball and not very fun to tackle. Strong back, easily runs secondary defenders over and pushes piles in short yards. Great contact balance, not an easy guy to bring down. Pretty good vision, will make you be gap discipline.
cons: Almost never was used in the pass game, 21 career receptions in 5 years. Older RB prospect, 5th year coming out. He is very slow changing direction and doesn’t have good speed.
take: Ibrahim is a great 2 down runner and would have been perfect in 1990. The game favors faster more explosive players now but that doesn’t mean theres no role for a throw back strong physical RB like him. He can be a great thunder to another backs lighting.
RB Devon Achane Texas A&M 74
info: Achane was a top 4 star RB coming out of Missouri City TX and somehow chose Texas A&M over the power house of Syracuse. He immediatley got playing time in 2020 where he got 43 carries for 364 yards and a 91 PFF grade. By his junior year he became there top RB and ran the ball 196 times for 1,100 yards and 8 TDs with an 89.8 run grade.
pros: 3 straight 89.8+ PFF rush grades with a total of 2,349 yards at 6.4 YPC. Forced 51 missed tackes with 705 of his 1,100 yards after contact. Could be an explosive change of pace back, he was amazing when he was used sparingly rather then the work horse. Produced with terrible blocking in front of him, not may opportunities for him to get free yards. Great cuts, can stop and start on a dime. Stronger contact balance that you would assume for a 180 pound back. Uses a stiff arm pretty well, can surprise defenders with a quick stiff arm. He has angle breaking speed, can get to the edge of the defense with ease. Good vision on zone concepts, rarely hits the wrong hole and makes the most of what he has.
cons: A terrible pass protector, 27.2 pass block grade with a 10% pressure rate. Small back at 180 who struggles to run up the middle, 3.7 YPC there. Not as effective when he has to carry the bulk of the work in the backfield, efficiency numbers significantly dropped in his lone year as the guy. Don’t love him in a man scheme, a little to bounce happy there.
take: Teams always are looking for a “home run hitter” at RB and that’s exactly what Achane is. He’s such a good athlete he makes defenders look silly, his jump cuts and speed leave defenders in the dust and is dangerous every time he has the ball. He has the ability to be a work horse but he’s most effective as a change of pace back that will take advantage of a tired defense.
TE Luke Musgrave Oregon St 74
info: 11 receptions 169 yards 1 TD.
pros: 6’6 250, a very good TE build. Good and smooth athlete, can play from the slot. Was on Bruce Feldmans freak list, a versatile athlete with good testing numbers.
cons: Injured his knee after the 2nd game of the season in 2022. Not much of a run blocker. Not many targets but a 16% drop rate. Not great at finding open space and creating separation.
take: Musgrave is very much a developmental TE, he’s got the size and athleticism to be a good TE in the league but we haven’t seen it yet. The early season injury hurt the chances but he’s worth a mid round flyer.
WR Kayshon Boutte LSU 74
info: Boutte was a 5 star recruit out of New Iberia LA where he was an All State receiver and a highly sought after recruit. He chose to stay home and go to the National Champion LSU tigers, he was immediately thought of as their number 1 but he always seemed to fall short of the very high expectations. His career highs were 48 receptions, 735 yards and 9 TDs which are solid but not top WR numbers. His career came to an end in a very interesting end when he said he would return but some off field issues arose and he declared.
pros: 5 star recruit and a true junior. Solid build at 6 foot 200 and has good speed to go along with it.
cons: Has some off field concerns at LSU. Has drop issues, at 11% drop rate. Hate his effort on routes, he doesn’t work to get open and he’s lazy.
take: Boutte is a case of all the talent in the world but non of the effort. It makes me upset to watch such a physically talented WR play the way he does.
WR Jalin Hyatt Tennessee 74
info: Hyatt was a 4 star recruit out of Dutch Fork HS in SC where he led his team to back to back undefeated seasons while breaking his HS's receiving records .He initially committed to play of the Hokies before flipping his commitment to Tennessee. His Freshman year he got on start and had some use getting 276 receiving yards and 2 TDs. his sophomore year was more of the same but really broke out in 2022 and developed a great connection with Hendon Hooker. In 2022 he won the Biletnikoff and was named to the 1st team All SEC team after racking up 1,267 yards and 15 TDs.
pros: Accolades his senior year where as good as it gets. Great speed, can put on the burners and pull away from people. Solid hands, not just a speed guy who can't catch, he can catch through contact.
cons: One year of being a full time starter. Mostly a slot receiver in college, 87% of his snaps from there. Only got a 77 PFF grade, not whatyou expect from the Biletnikoff winner. Very thin frame, needs to add some size for NFL physicality. Awful out of the break and off the line, not quick just fast.
take: Hyatt can run fast, that's about where the positives end. He's not a polished receiver, he's not good out of breaks and doesn't do well with physicality. His top end outcome is a deep threat only.
WR Parker Washington Penn St 74
info: 46 receptions 611 yards 2 TDs.
pros: Stocky build at 5’10 215 and a true junior. Good hands, 5% drop and a surprisingly high contested catch rate. Unreal ball skills, can catch a ball in any position and can catch away from his body. Can add YAC with his center of gravity and strong lower half.
cons: Never really was the alpha in the receiving core, best season came with Jahan Dotson as the number 1. Not that fast and shifty for the play style that would fit his build. Doesn’t create the separation with his routes that you would like from a 5’10 slot guy.
take: Washington is an interesting eval, he’s got a weird stocky build for the position and isn’t that top end athlete. But, he’s very good with the ball in his hands and can go pluck the ball out of the air if it’s within his range. He will be able to step in as a return man and if he gets craftier with his routes he could be a great slot.
RB Sean Tucker Syracuse 73
info: Tucker was one of the top RBs coming out of Owings Mills MD where he was also a track star winning the 100 and 200 m as a junior. He got looks from a few schools like Wisconsin and Syracuse and chose to stay closer to home and commit the Orange. His opportunity came early while many opt outs and injuries caused him to be bumped up the depth chart. He ran for 626 yards that true freshman year and put his name in the spotlight of potential NFL RBs. He solidified that thought by playing great in 2021, he ran for 1,515 with 6.1 YPC and 12 TDs while breaking 66 missed tackles and 4.11 YPC after contact. He was an All American after that year and was on the Doak Walker award radar heading in to 2022. It was a little disappointing of a 2022 season but he still played well, accounting for much of Syracuse’s total yards he ran for 1062 yards with 11 TDs but only averaged 2.79 Yards after contact.
pros: Well-built RB with good speed, 5'10 210 and has plenty of breakaway runs, once he gets into space he’s gone. Produced on a Syracuse team that didn't have much talent, the OL was awful. Has good power to run up the middle and grind for yards. Flashes some good body control on receptions out of the backfield. Good in the open field, a nice side step to go along with his great speed.
cons: Not the best out of the backfield, 13.7 drop percentage for his career. Doesn’t have the short area quickness to make a guy miss in a phone booth and accelerate through a hole. Likes to bounce to the outside a lot, granted his OL did no favors.
take: Tucker was the best skill player from Syracuse in years, his OL did him no favors but he flashed his extreme talent anyway. He’s a solid size to go along with great long speed which teams are going to like. He will never be a top guy in the NFL (he’s not breaking tackles left and right) but he can definitely be a good RB for many years.
RB Israel Abanikanda Pitt 73
info: 241 carries 1,426 yards 20 TDs.
pros: Young prospect, only 20 years old. Had an amazing senior season, ran for 1,400 yards and 20 TDs with a 90.6 PFF grade. Great speed, ran away from so many defenders last year. Can break arm tackles and smaller defenders tackles with adequate strength.
cons: Was a non-factor in the pass game, never blocked well and only caught 12 balls. Doesn’t have the great quickness and agility that a speed back would want. Not a great tackle breaker, he’s more of a maximize what you blocked for back.
take: Abanikanda made himself some money this year with a break out 1,400 yard season. He is a back that will show how good your OL is, if the hole is there he will take advantage of it with his speed. But, if you ask him to create by himself that’s not his game and will turn losses into gains.
RB Chase Brown Illinois 73
info: 329 carries 1,632 yards 10 TDs
pros: Lead the nation in yards and was the bell cow for Illinois. Has very good speed for the position, hit 22.5 MPH in a game. Pretty good vision, lets block develop and can bust through the line.
cons: 5th year player who only broke out his last year. Didn’t lead the league in rushing without an absurd number of carries. He’s on the slimmer side for the position, doesn’t run through contact well.
take: Brown was Illinois offense last year after 4 longer years of waiting to break out. He’s got the great speed to make in impact in the NFL but the strength is a real concern. He should be able to contribute to a backfield immediately.
RB Tyjae Spears Tulane 73
info: 231 carries 1,586 yards 19 TDs.
pros: 63 forced missed tackles and 4.55 yards after contact. Consistently high PFF grades all 4 years. Solid out of the backfield in his career. Has great agility and athleticism, can take advantage of small windows and create big plays.
cons: Small for the position, 5’11 195 he’s a slim back. All his targets are checkdowns. Didn’t play the highest level competition, could struggle with better physicality at the next level.
take: Spears has shown he is a good back for the last 2 years and solidified his place in the NFL in 2022. He’s a very good athlete with the production to back it up that he should be drafted. He’s on the smaller side though which will limit his draft stock but he could end up making an impact in the NFL.
TE Brevyn Spann-Ford Minnesota 73
info: 42 receptions 497 yards 2 TDs.
pros: Big TE at 6’7 270, he is a plus in the run game. Great length, can pass block with the length he has and extend to catch any ball.
cons: 5th year player that took 3 years for him to contribute. Not a plus athlete, never going to be a top receiving threat.
take: Spann-Ford is a big run blocking TE that has some receiving upside to his game. He’s not the extra OL like some TE’s are but he can easily step in to be the TE2 and make an impact.
TE Tucker Kraft South Dakota St 73
info: 27 Receptions 348 yards 3 TDs.
pros: Perfect TE build at 6’5 255. Very good against FCS competition, easily shrugged off defenders. Solid hands and good catch radius.
cons: Got hurt week 1 against Iowa and missed 2 months. Played in the FCS against weaker competition. Drops may be a concern at 10% drop rate. Looked out of place at times blocking FBS talent. Not at plus athlete that will run by anyone.
take: Kraft was very good for South Dakota using his great size and strength to bully lower-level competition. It will be an adjustment to the NFL for sure but he has the ability to play in the league.
WR Cedric Tillman Tennessee 73
info: 37 receptions 417 yards 3 TDs.
pros: Good size, 6’3 215. Solid hands, 5% career drop rate. Good body control and making plays on the ball through contact.
cons: Injured for his final season for 6 weeks causing production to drop off. 1 out of 5 years he caught more than 40 balls. Not a good athlete, not quick and the speed is average.
take: Tillman had a great 4th season where he had over 1,000 yards after a down first 3 years. He came back for his 5th and final year to add on to his production but he got hurt. He’s a big bodied receiver that can make a play on the ball no matter who’s on him but he’s not that good athlete that will create separation.
WR Nathaniel Dell Houston 73
info: 108 receptions 1,399 yards 17 TDs.
pros: Back-to-back 1,300 yard receiving seasons with 30 TDs. Amazing athlete, has the agility and speed you need to play at 165. Great deep threat with the ability to shake defenders deep and be wide open.
cons: Drops the ball more than you would like at 9%. 5’10 165, he’s a very small receiver. Played against lower level of competition than you would like.
take: Dell is Zay flowers but older and played at Houston. He’s way undersized but he’s such a great athlete he made up for it. He can be a teams return man as well as maybe develop into a deep threat out of the slot.
LB Mikel Jones Syracuse 72
info: Jones was a surprise commit to Syracuse after attending IMG academy and earning a high 3 star recruit and getting offers from many top SEC schools. He immediately played as a true freshman getting 4 starts and 38 tackles. He started for the remainder of his career getting 4 INTs in 2020 and 70 tackles in 2021 along with an All ACC first team selection.
pros: Good in coverage, finds receivers in space well and reads designed screens well. Good patients and athleticism to close in fast.
cons: Not a big linebacker, weak side only.
take: 
QB Max Duggan TCU 72
info: Duggan was the Gatorade player of the year in Iowa and was the top QB in the state of Iowa in 2018. He had interest from a lot of big time programs like ND and OSU but chose to go to up and coming TCU to lead the horned frogs to new heights. He did just that, he has always battled through injuries but started all 4 years of his career and always played solid football. He improved his grade from a 67 to 79 to 76 all the way to 85.6 as a senior. That final year he lead TCU to its first College football playoff and was named a Heisman Finalist for his efforts. He threw for 3,320 yards 30 TDs and 4 INTs along with over 500 yards rushing.
pros: Very willing runner, not scared of contact or to make a play. He’s got grit, went through a lot of medical problems but still kept pushing through. Decent arm/size combination, he wont look out of place on an NFL field. Can throw well from multiple arm angles and is a playmaker.
cons: Wasn’t the week 1 starter, never was the guy coming into the season. Not as accurate as you would like, misses too many open throws. A lot of big 12 plays where he has a lot of time and cant find open receivers early. Doesn’t trust his arm enough, multiple NFL open throws he passes up.
take: Duggan is a great college QB that you cant help but root for. He’s got the grit you look for and can will a team to victory if needed. He’s not very accurate though and his physical ability isn’t much to fall back on if you want him to be a franchise guy. He can stick around the NFL a while as a high end back up, he’s a version of Taylor Heinike.
RB Deuce Vaughn Kansas St 72
info: Vaughn was born in Fayetteville AR and moved to play HS football in Round Rock TX. He accumulated 5,472 all purpose yards to go along with 50 TDs in his career there. He had offers from many SEC schools but chose K State over them where he played as a true freshman and was named the Big 12 freshman of the year after getting 1,221 all purpose yards. His next season in 2021 was great, he had over a 91 PFF grade while rushing for over 1,500 yards and was All big 12 1st team. In 2022 he had a similar statistical year to make his mark as one of the best backs Kansas State has ever had.
pros: He's been a work horse for Kansas State, 3000 yards and over 500 carries in the last 2 years. Forced 106 missed tackles in the last 2 years with 27 TDs. Doesn't fumble often, only 2 career fumbles on 646 carries. Very good out of the backfield with a career 117 receptions and 1,275 yards. Great change of direction and quickness to his game, makes people completely whiff at times. Has break away speed and wont be caught by any LBs. Not afraid of contact, wont dance away from it.
cons: He's beyond small, you wont find a smaller back in the league at 5'6 175. Under an average of 3 yards after contact. Awful pass blocker, 21.3 is his highest PFF grade. Not going to get extra yards through contact. Probably wont be able to pass block.
take: Everything about Vaughn has to have the disclaimer of he’s so small. It’s hard to succeed in the NFL at his size but he can find a nice role out of the backfield in spread situations especially.
RB Chris Rodriguez Kentucky 71
info: 175 carries 904 yards 6 TDs.
pros: 2 grades over 90 for rushing. A career 6.2 YPC with 3,642 yards. Big well built back at 5’11 224. Packs a punch on initial contact, can easily run over defenders. Runs angry, arm tackles wont stop him and he’s not a fun back to bring down.
cons: Suspended for an unknown reason to start the 2022 season. Older prospect, this is his 5th year in college. Never a plus receiver, essentially a running back only. Can want to get too north and south sometimes, running straight into lineman. Not much quickness to his game, won’t make people whiff in space.
take: Rodriguez is an old school runner that would be a great back in the 80’s. He’s powerful has solid speed and put up numbers through out his career. He’s got the off field red flags and isn’t much of a pass catcher but that shouldn’t prevent him from finding a home in the NFL.
RB Keaton Mitchell East Carolina 71
info: 201 carries 1,452 yards 14 TDs.
pros: Back to back 1,000 yard seasons with a PFF rush grade if 93.9. Forced 75 missed tackles in 2022 while rushing for 7.2 YPA. Good change of direction, low center of gravity makes cutting easy for him. Explosive athlete, can accelerate and run past defenders.
cons: Not a very good pass protector, he’s only 5’9 183. Level of competition is a concern. No strength to his game, never going to be a physically dominate RB.
take: Mitchell is an electric back with solid contact balance and good athleticism. His biggest knocks are his size and competition level which are real concerns. He should be able to be a returner or maybe even find himself as a change of pace back in the league.
QB Malik Cunningham Louisville 69
info: Cunningham was a 3 star recruit coming out of Park Crossing HS in Alabama where he drew intrest from a few top SEC teams befor deciding to go with Louisville. He redshirted in 2017 before getting 3 starts his red shirt freshman season in 2018 where he ran for more yards than he threw. He was the full time starter from 2019 on where he always put up some impressive numbers. between 2019 and 2021 he threw for 7,600 yards and 61 TDs and also added 2,500 rush yards as well. That 2021 season was truly impressive, he received a 91 PFF grade and passed for about 3000 yards and over 1000 rush yards. 2022 was supposed to be the year where he put himself in the top of the draft conversation but he fell short of that oly throwing for 1,567 yards and 8 TDs and 5 INTs.
pros: Running back like skills at the QB spot, on 108 attempts in 2021 he forced 51 missed tackles. Good at throwing on the run, pretty good when he escapes the pocket. Good base and throwing motion, does a good job in the pocket with his technique. Very shifty, can make LBs miss in space easily.
cons: Arm strength is mediocre, not going to look good on an NFL field. Pocket presence is not good, a lot of drifting and trying to create with his legs. Doesn't throw into windows well, not sure he trusts his arm.
take: Cunningham is a very good athlete and has put up a great season in college. But, he's a little inconsistent threw the air and doesn't have the arm to be a high end starter.
RB Tavion Thomas Utah 69
info: 142 carries 676 yards 7 TDs.
pros: Back to back years of 85+ PFF rush grades and 28 TDs. Great size at 6’2 240, has the power back build. Always falling forward for extra yardage.
cons: 10 fumbles on 476 attempts. Took a step back in 2022, graded lower and rushed for 500 less yards. Not a good receiver out of the backfield, a career 50 receiving yards. Has no juice to his game, the speed and quickness are lacking.
take: Thomas is your prototypical big back that can play on short yardage plays. He’s not going to be a lead guy anywhere but can fill the power back role if needed.
RB Evan Hull Northwestern 69
info: 220 carries 914 yards 5 TDs.
pros: Student of the game, he has good vision with a solid feel for setting up defenders. Can produce out of the backfield, over 500 yards receiving. Good at running feet through contact, he will churn for extra yards.
cons: Poor pass blocking grades, 92% pass block rate. Not going to make people miss cleanly, will break a tackle but isn’t dangerous after that. Athleticism is lacking, the quickness and speed are barely NFL level.
take: Hull will not be impressing anyone with a highlight tape but he does a lot of things good enough to play in the NFL. He’s a back up through and through but he could be a nice 3rd back on a team.
RB Camerun Peoples Appalachian St 68
info: 100 carries 592 yards 5 TDs.
pros: 6’2 225, good size. Good combination of size and speed for special teams.
cons: 5th year RB with only 592 yards his 5th year. Runs way too upright. No quicks to his game, not an explosive athlete.
take: Peoples had a solid RB career at Appalachian State where he ran for 2,800 yards. He’s not a good enough runner to be a guy in the NFL but his size and speed give a little hope to him making an NFL roster.
