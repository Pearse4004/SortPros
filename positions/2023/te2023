TE Michael Mayer Notre Dame 80
info: Mayer was the number 2 TE recruit and the Gatorade Kentucky player of the year. He had all the schools offering him so he decided to go to the TE factory ND. He immediately flashed as a top TE along side Tommy Tremble. His first year he caught 42 balls for 450 yards and solidified himself as NDs next great TE. He backed it up the next 2 years catching over 65 balls and 800 yards each year with a PFF grade of 92.5 in 2022 where he was named an All American.
pros: True junior at 6’4 250 with a 90+ PFF grade and an All American. Great run blocker, very willing and strong at the point of attack. Strong hands, can catch a ball while being hit by an LB.
cons: Not the modern day 4.4 blazing fast TE that can play WR as well.
take: Mayer will be at least a solid starting TE for an NFL team that is his floor. He’s a big strong TE that has great hands and an ability to get open. If he can just get a little more athleticism he can be a top TE in the NFL.
TE Dalton Kincaid Utah 81
info: 70 receptions 890 yards 8 TDs.
pros: 91.7 PFF receiving grade in 2022, top TE in the country. 1.6% drop percentage, great hands. Good athlete that can use his speed and strength after the catch. Great ball skills, very natural and strong hands. Good routes, knows how to sit in zone and create separation.
cons: More of a slot TE than an inline blocking TE, he can get tossed around while blocking. Was a 5th year player and still not a good blocker.
take: Kincaid is an interesting evaluation; he didn’t start playing football until 2017 but is a natural at it. He has the ability to be one of the best receiving TE’s in the league with his solid athleticism and great hands. He’s not your old school TE that can block inline but if he can work on that and continue to develop, he will be a top 5 TE in the NFL.
TE Darnell Washington Georgia 76
info: 28 receptions 454 yards 2 TDs.
pros: He sticks out on a field of SEC players by towering over everyone, he’s 6’7 270. True junior who player all 3 years with above a 68 PFF grade. Almost like having an extra OL, 81 run block grade. Solid as a check down receiver, wont just be an extra OL.
cons: Never was a volume TE receiver, 45 career receptions. Will never be a receiving threat, he’s just a guy as a receiver.
take: Washington has his clear strength and that’s run blocking, he’s a massive TE with the ability to contribute to the pass game. He’s not going to be an impact receiving threat ever but he should be able to easily contribute to a team.
TE Luke Musgrave Oregon St 76
info: 11 receptions 169 yards 1 TD.
pros: 6’6 250, a very good TE build. Good and smooth athlete, can play from the slot. Was on Bruce Feldmans freak list, a versatile athlete with good testing numbers.
cons: Injured his knee after the 2nd game of the season in 2022. Not much of a run blocker. Not many targets but a 16% drop rate. Not great at finding open space and creating separation.
take: Musgrave is very much a developmental TE, he’s got the size and athleticism to be a good TE in the league but we haven’t seen it yet. The early season injury hurt the chances but he’s worth a mid round flyer.
TE Sam Laporta Iowa 75
info: 58 receptions 648 yards 1 TD.
pros: Good with the ball in his hands, 20 missed tackles forced. Good athlete, mover very well for a TE and can run WR routes. Iowa TE, not a stranger to blocking inline.
cons: Drops can be a concern for him. Doesn’t have the strength to be a good run blocker, they had him as a big slot a lot.
take: Laporta probably isn’t the next George Kittle just because he’s an Iowa TE. He’s a good athlete that’s a little undersized which hurts his run blocking. He is similar to Kittle in the fact that he’s good with the ball in his hands but he will need to get stronger to become a good NFL TE.
TE Brevyn Spann-Ford Minnesota 72
info: 42 receptions 497 yards 2 TDs.
pros: Big TE at 6’7 270, he is a plus in the run game. Great length, can pass block with the length he has and extend to catch any ball.
cons: 5th year player that took 3 years for him to contribute. Not a plus athlete, never going to be a top receiving threat.
take: Spann-Ford is a big run blocking TE that has some receiving upside to his game. He’s not the extra OL like some TE’s are but he can easily step in to be the TE2 and make an impact.
TE Tucker Kraft South Dakota St 73
info: 27 Receptions 348 yards 3 TDs.
pros: Perfect TE build at 6’5 255. Very good against FCS competition, easily shrugged off defenders. Solid hands and good catch radius.
cons: Got hurt week 1 against Iowa and missed 2 months. Played in the FCS against weaker competition. Drops may be a concern at 10% drop rate. Looked out of place at times blocking FBS talent. Not at plus athlete that will run by anyone.
take: Kraft was very good for South Dakota using his great size and strength to bully lower-level competition. It will be an adjustment to the NFL for sure but he has the ability to play in the league.
TE Joel Wilson Central Michigan 71
info: 44 receptions 445 yards 6 TD 80.9 RECV 45.5 RBLK.
pros: 10.25 inch hands, massive hands. Didn’t drop a ball in 2022. Very good blocker, good in pass pro and gives good effort in run game. Can make some good catches away from his body, a big target.
cons: Didn’t do anything for his first 3 years. Not a great route runner, wont be separating well. Needs to block with better pad level. A tad undersized at 6'3 242.
take: Wilson is a solid reliable TE with the ability to block and catch passes. Wilson is solid in pass pro and trys hard in the run game but needs to work on his pad level in the league. As for pass catching, he wont be a vertical threat but his hands are very good and he is a big safe target to throw to. He could easily become a starter if he bulks up a little and works on his leverage.
TE Thomas Greaney Alabany 68
info: 51 receptions 700 yards 9 TD 86.1 RECV 62.4 RBLK.
pros: Good size at 6’5 255. Smooth route runner, does a nice job accelerating out of breaks. Pretty good hands, only one drop in 2022.
cons: Not aggressive in the run game, wont move anyone. Can’t pass block total liability.
take: Greaney looked out of place against Baylor in the run game. He can’t hold up to physicality in the box. He’s a solid receiver though, runs well and has good hands.
TE Davis Allen Clemson 69
info: 39 receptions 443 yards 5 TD 71 RECV 69 RBLK.
pros: Solid build at 6’5 246. Very solid hands, 1 drop in 2023 and a 91% contested catch rate.
cons: Weak in the run game, doesn’t have much strength to his game. Not a plus runner after the catch. Not the best athlete, doesn’t move well in space. Doesn’t separate in routes, not quick out of his breaks. Most of his receptions are just little flat routes.
take: Allen is an average TE with very good hands. He’s a little slim and that shows in his run game strength but he doesn’t have the athleticism to make him a dangerous receiving threat. He does check all the boxes to play TE in the NFL so he should get a shot to be TE3 somewhere.
TE Payne Durham Purdue 68
info: 56 receptions 560 yards 8 TD 70.3 RECV 56.7 RBLK.
pros: Good size at 6’5 258 and 33 inch arms. Big strong blocker, can move people in the run game. Solid with the ball, he’s strong and can break tackles.
cons: Slow feet, will get ran around trying to block in space or on the line. Not a good route runner, he’s not quick at all. Mediocre athleticism.
take: Durham is a big strong TE that could be a solid 2rd string inline blocker for a team. He’s got the size but he’s not a good athlete. His lack of athleticism kills his ability to separate or block in space.
TE Noah Gindorff North Dakota St 70
info: 6 receptions 74 yards 1 TD.
pros: Big man at 6’6 268. Very good run blocker, has great power to his game. Solid possession receiver, has solid hands.
cons: Not a good athlete, not suddenness. Played against FCS competition. Career 524 yards, he wasn’t much of a receiver threat.
take: Gindorff is baby Michael Mayer, he’s a big strong blocker that can make the catches necessary. He’s not a very good athlete though, he will not be a plus receiver in the NFL. He could be a good TE2 for a team that excels in run blocking.
TE Zack Kuntz Old Dominion 67
info: 12 receptions 144 yards 2 TD 67.3 RECV 67.5 RBLK.
pros: Former Penn State receiver, was a solid recruit. Had 73 receptions in 2021.
cons: Too long of a build at 6’8 245. Got hurt after week 5 in 2023. Soft run blocker, doesn’t do it at all.
take: Kuntz has good length and is a fine athlete but he’s not a good blocker at all. He’s soft in the run game and it will only be worse in the NFL. He will struggle to make a roster.
TE Cameron Latu Alabama 71
info: 30 receptions 376 yards 4 TD 60.6 RECV 50 RBLK.
pros: Solid size at 6’4 248. Was Alabamas starting TE. Solid blocker, works hard in the run game.
cons: Not a very good athlete, wont wow anyone. Didn’t grade out too well. Isn’t dynamic with the ball in his hands.
take: Latu is a very solid and was an big part of Alabama’s offense. He was solid in the pass game and run game. He just wont excite anyone with his athleticism and will be limited to a TE 2 at most.
TE Will Mallory Miami 68
info: 42 receptions 542 yards 3 TD 78 RECV 36.6 RBLK.
pros: Solid athlete, can stretch the field vertically.
cons: 6’4 239, he is undersized for a TE. Too many drops and doesn’t make contested catches. Bad run blocker, has no strength.
take: Mallory is a vertical threat with solid athleticism. The issue is he has little to no strength and can’t block. He also has questionable hands so he isn’t going to be a reliable TE.
TE Kyle Patterson Air Force 68
info: 3 receptions 32 yards 0 TD 66.3 RECV 84.4 RBLK.
pros: Good size at 6’5 250. Great run blocker, very willing.
cons: Almost no receiving ability, has 18 career receptions.
take: Patterson is from a very run heavy offense where he had 3 total receptions 2022. He’s a total project but he could be a good blocker for a team.
TE Luke Schoonmaker Michigan 74
info: 35 receptions 418 yards 3 TD 78.7 RECV 55.7 RBLK.
pros: Good size at 6’5 250. Solid blocker, has some mass behind him and works hard. Decent athlete, can get vertical and create a little separation.
cons: Very old, will be 25 early in the season. Wasn’t good in contested catch situations. Wont add run after the catch.
take: Schoonmaker is already ready to play in the NFL, his size and strength are solid for the position. He’s a plus blocker that can threaten the defense down the seam. He doesn’t have much upside though, he’s an ok athlete that struggles catching contested targets and doesn’t break many tackles.
TE Brenton Strange Penn St 69
info: 32 receptions 362 yards 5 TD 73.2 RECV 60.5 RBLK.
pros: Solid run after the catch. Has above average athleticism, can run vertically.
cons: Undersized at 6’3 246. Not the best blocker, he’s a little small and plays a little unbalanced.
take: Strange is a pretty good athlete for the TE position. His size is going to be a concern because his blocking at the next level will be an issue. Although he’s good with the ball in his hands, he will have a hard time getting on the field because of other aspects of his game.
TE Leonard Taylor Cincinnati 67
info: 18 receptions 170 yards 2 TD 59.1 RECV 54.1 RBLK.
pros: Good size at 6’5 248. Solid athlete with good RAC.
cons: Bad hands, 9% drop rate which is a concern for TE’s. Almost no production. Graded poorly. Bad run blocker, super weak at the point of attack.
take: Taylor played bad, there is no other way to say it. He’s an awful blocker that didn’t produce in the receiving game. He has a shot at the NFL because of his size and athleticism, but he has a long way to go.
TE Travis Vokolek Nebraska 67
info: 20 receptions 240 yards 2 TD 63.4 RECV 65.7 RBLK.
pros: Good size at 6’6 259. Decent strength, solid run blocker.
cons: Little production in college, 656 yards in 5 years. Old player, has been in college since 2017. Not a good athlete, wont separate on routes or stretch a defense.
take: Vokolek is a big strong tight end that looks the part. He isn’t a plus athlete or receiver so he wouldn’t add much to a passing game. He could be a 3rd TE if a team needs a big strong backup TE.
TE Blake Whiteheart Wake Forest 68
info: 24 receptions 295 yards 3 TD 62.4 RECV 65.8 RBLK.
pros: Decent size at 6’4 249. Solid hands, didn’t drop a ball in 2022. Team captain. Solid possession receiver, can get open underneath and catch the ball.
cons: Not much production in his career. Doesn’t add plus run after catch. Strength and athleticism is below average, won’t move anyone in the run game or run by anyone.
take: Whiteheart is a solid TE with good hands and a solid senior year. He doesn’t offer much upside because his blocking and athleticism are below average but he’s good enough for a backup TE.
TE Josh Whyle Cincinnati 73
info: 32 receptions 326 yards 3 TD 68.5 RECV 69.5 RBLK.
pros: Good size at 6’6 260. Had a great 2020 season, 92.9 RECV grade. Has the movement skills to run good routes and get down the seam. Pretty strong in the run game, if he gets his hands on he can move people.
cons: Doesn’t add much with the run after catch. Not the best blocker right now, loses leverage and balance too often.
take: Whyle has it all, he’s a good size with solid strength and athleticism. He can immediately come in and be a solid TE2 with TE1 upside.
TE Brayden Willis Oklahoma 72
info: 39 receptions 503 yards 7 TD 63.6 RECV 71.7 RBLK.
pros: Very good with the ball in his hands, 14 MTF on 39 receptions. 500 yards in 2022, good production. Good athlete, he can block in space and be a plus vertical threat.
cons: Undersized, at 6’3 239 he doesn’t have the prototypical size. Questionable hands, a few too many drops. Played in a very spread heavy Oklahoma offense. Strength is below average, needs to add muscle to his frame.
take: Willis is an undersized athletic TE that was a good receiver for Oklahoma. He played in a very spread heavy offense so he will need to adjust to the NFL style of inline blocking. If he adds strength and can acclimate to play inline TE he could be a good NFL TE.
TE Princeton Fant Tennessee 66
info: 22 receptions 241 yards 3 TD 60 RECV 50.5 RBLK.
pros: He’s a big receiver, solid athlete.
cons: Undersized, at 6’1 238 he doesn’t have the prototypical size. Not the best hands.
take: Fant is too small to play NFL TE 6’1 isn’t tall enough and he’s not a good enough athlete to make up for it.
TE Daniel Barker Michigan St 67
info: 21 receptions 239 yards 2 TD 69.2 RECV 62.1 RBLK.
pros: Smooth route runner, can get himself open.
cons: 6’3 240, he is undersized. Bad hands, 11.5% drop rate and 40 contested catch rate.
take: Barker is an average college TE which isn’t a good sign for the NFL. He’s a smooth player that you can move around but the size, strength and speed combo isn’t good.
