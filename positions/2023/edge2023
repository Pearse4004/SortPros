EDGE Will Anderson Alabama 91
info: Anderson was a 5-star recruit with offers to every major program coming out of Dutchtown HA in GA. He stepped onto campus ready to play earning a starting spot immediately and was a Freshman All-American. He put up 60 pressures with 8 sacks that year and graded out as a 79.1 as a true freshman in the SEC. He one upped himself his true sophomore year by leading the nation in pressures with 81 and 15 sacks grading out at an 89.9 and leading the Bama defense to the national championship game. He was a 1st team All-American and won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for his outstanding season. He came back his junior year and picked up where he left off. He’s was a stud racking up 14 sacks and being named an All American again.
pros: Excellent run defender, packs a punch on initial impact. Powerful hands, can stun blockers and rip through like nothing. High level athlete, can get off the ball unbelievably well and can time up snaps well. High motor player, good ant working in stunts and cleaning up in the run game.
cons: His length is sub-par for a top level edge, he doesn’t stick out on the field just looking at him. Overall size isn’t what you would want at 6’4 243.
take: Anderson is a superb athlete with the strength and athleticism to dominate tackles with speed and power. He’s a great run defender as well so he can do it all, he even lined up a 3 tech in a bear front. If he was a tad longer he would be the first pick no doubt but he’s an amazing player that wont get out of the top 5.
EDGE Myles Murphy Clemson 87
info: Murphy was a 5 star recruit out of Marietta GA where he had offers from everywhere. After a dominated HS career he joined DJ and Bresee enrolling at Clemson to join the power house up and coming program. He showed out his freshman year getting 5 sacks and being named a freshman All American. He followed his amazing freshman season up with back to back All ACC selections and getting 15 sacks over those 2 years.
pros: The perfect edge build, an athletic 6’5 275. Graded 79 and above all 3 years of college, never even played average. 5 star recruit true junior, he has potential. Great burst off the line, can get up field in a hurry. Shows good bend, can rip and get to the edge with his athleticism. Has good power to his game, devastating long arm and can walk guys back with his length and strength.
cons: His grade dropped every year instead of showing improvement. ND LT ate his lunch, his hand fighting is under developed and will get beat by good technique every time. Can get beat when it's time to make the play because of lack of agility, needs to be a finisher.
take: Murphy is a lot like Walker from last year, he’s the prototypical edge player but is lacking development. Murphy has all the athletic traits you look for, the size, length, strength and athleticism to be a top DE in the league. He just needs to get in his bag and learn pass rush moves and the little things about playing DE and he will be an All Pro player.
EDGE Tyree Wilson Texas Tech 83
info: Wilson was a 3 star recruit out of Henderson TX where he was his districts defensive MVP. He initially chose Texas A&M where he played his freshman year before transferring to Texas Tech. He played well over the next 3 years developing into the teams best DL and capped his senior year off with 8 sacks and All American honors.
pros: Great size and length, at 6’6 280 with 35+ inch arms he is a great edge build. Steady improvement every year. Don’t try to block him with a TE, he will dominate him physically. Has a nice long arm and an inside swim.
cons: Never was a star pass rusher, maxing out at 8 sacks. Not a great athlete, not much explosion off the ball or natural power. Can’t win around the edge, the speed and bend isn’t there.
take: Wilson is an impressive looking edge defender that plays with good strength and effort. He’s missing the athleticism you look for in a edge defender, he wont threaten the edge on NFL tackles and will have to really lean on his length. He should be able to start immediately but his ceiling isn’t as high as you would like.
EDGE Nolan Smith Georgia 85
info: Smith was another 5 star recruit (Top 20 all time) coming out of IMG academy where he was recruited by everyone and went to the best defense in CFB Georgia. As a freshman he was a co winner of the Defensive newcomer of the year for Georgia after a 5 sack season. He didn’t play much in the 2020 season but came back in 2021 and graded at a 85 with 7 sacks during the national championship run for the Bulldogs. He came back his senior year to be a leader of that defense but he tore his pec 8 games
pros: Former 5 star recruit that played well in college, good potential. Majoring in Math, not just a typical football player. Amazing athlete, OL can’t keep up with his speed and agility. Swipes hands well and can bend the edge, easily wins to the outside. Surprising power and can explode into OL and drive them back.
cons: On the smaller side at 6’3 235, not the size of a typical edge. Between injuries and playing time he wasn’t an every down player. Not sure about him setting an edge in the run game, more of a disruptive gap shooter.
take: If smith had prototypical size he would be a top 5 pick. His top recruiting ranking was no joke, he’s a freak athletically, he’s got the speed, bend and agility to make plays in the backfield. He doesn’t have the strength and length a traditional edge has, but he can still pass rush at a high level. He has a shot to be an all pro type player if he can hold up to NFL physicality.
EDGE Lukas Van-Ness Iowa 81
info: 46 pressures 9 sacks 15 tackles 80.9 RDEF 74.3 PRSH.
pros: Solid size, 6’5 269, he looks the part. 33.9 win rate on true pass sets. Very good hands, placement in the run game is good and uses them in pass rush moves well. Has a solid bull rush in his game. Can rush from both the edge and interior. Great motor, a student of the game.
cons: Not a great athlete, wont blow by tackles with speed, has to win with a good move. For some unknown reason he never started, was just a heavily used sub.
take: Van Ness doesn’t have many weaknesses, you would like to see him be a better athlete and play more but that’s it. He’s a strong solid pass rusher that can overpower tackles and use his hands well in both the run and pass game. He’s got some serious potential considering he wasn’t a starter and played 2 years at Iowa so he may end up being the steal of the draft.
EDGE Isaiah Foskey Notre Dame 77
info: 33 pressures 12 sacks 26 tackles 67.8 RDEF 73.1 PRSH.
pros: Team captain for Notre Dame. Solid size at 6’5 262 and 33.75 inch arms. Good athlete, can get around the edge and bend to make a play. Solid hands, will swipe hands off him and try to re fit to get good leverage.
cons: Plays with poor balance, on the ground too often. Not a very powerful edge player, won’t bull many tackles and may get pushed in the run game.
take: Foskey has the makeup of a good edge rusher. He’s a 6’5 260 pound team captain with multiple 10 sack seasons. He’s missing the top level ability that is what you look for in high ceiling players, but he’s got good ability and should be an impact NFL player.
