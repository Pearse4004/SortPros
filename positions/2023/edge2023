EDGE Will Anderson Alabama 91
info: 65 pressures 14 sacks 23 tackles 86.7 RDEF 85.8 PRSH. 6'4 253 with 33 7/8 arms. Anderson was a 5-star recruit with offers to every major program coming out of Dutchtown HA in GA. He stepped onto campus ready to play earning a starting spot immediately and was a Freshman All-American. He put up 60 pressures with 8 sacks that year and graded out as a 79.1 as a true freshman in the SEC. He one upped himself his true sophomore year by leading the nation in pressures with 81 and 15 sacks grading out at an 89.9 and leading the Bama defense to the national championship game. He was a 1st team All-American and won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for his outstanding season. He came back his junior year and picked up where he left off. He’s was a stud racking up 14 sacks and being named an All American again.
pros: Excellent run defender, packs a punch on initial impact. Powerful hands, can stun blockers and rip through like nothing. High level athlete, can get off the ball unbelievably well and can time up snaps well. High motor player, good ant working in stunts and cleaning up in the run game.
cons: His length is sub-par for a top level edge, he doesn’t stick out on the field just looking at him. Overall size isn’t what you would want at 6’4 243.
take: Anderson is a superb athlete with the strength and athleticism to dominate tackles with speed and power. He’s a great run defender as well so he can do it all, he even lined up a 3 tech in a bear front. If he was a tad longer he would be the first pick no doubt but he’s an amazing player that wont get out of the top 5.
EDGE Lukas Van-Ness Iowa 87
info: 46 pressures 9 sacks 15 tackles 80.9 RDEF 74.3 PRSH. 6'5 272 with 34 arms.
pros: Solid size, 6’5 269, he looks the part. 33.9 win rate on true pass sets. Very good hands, placement in the run game is good and uses them in pass rush moves well. Has a solid bull rush in his game. Can rush from both the edge and interior. Great motor, a student of the game.
cons: Not a great athlete, wont blow by tackles with speed, has to win with a good move. For some unknown reason he never started, was just a heavily used sub.
take: Van Ness doesn’t have many weaknesses, you would like to see him be a better athlete and play more but that’s it. He’s a strong solid pass rusher that can overpower tackles and use his hands well in both the run and pass game. He’s got some serious potential considering he wasn’t a starter and played 2 years at Iowa so he may end up being the steal of the draft.
EDGE Nolan Smith Georgia 86
info: 28 pressures 7 sacks 32 tackles 90.6 RDEF 79.1 PSRH. 6'2 238 with 32 5/8 arms. Smith was another 5 star recruit (Top 20 all time) coming out of IMG academy where he was recruited by everyone and went to the best defense in CFB Georgia. As a freshman he was a co winner of the Defensive newcomer of the year for Georgia after a 5 sack season. He didn’t play much in the 2020 season but came back in 2021 and graded at a 85 with 7 sacks during the national championship run for the Bulldogs. He came back his senior year to be a leader of that defense but he tore his pec 8 games
pros: Former 5 star recruit that played well in college, good potential. Majoring in Math, not just a typical football player. Amazing athlete, OL can’t keep up with his speed and agility. Swipes hands well and can bend the edge, easily wins to the outside. Surprising power and can explode into OL and drive them back.
cons: On the smaller side at 6’3 235, not the size of a typical edge. Between injuries and playing time he wasn’t an every down player. Not sure about him setting an edge in the run game, more of a disruptive gap shooter.
take: If smith had prototypical size he would be a top 5 pick. His top recruiting ranking was no joke, he’s a freak athletically, he’s got the speed, bend and agility to make plays in the backfield. He doesn’t have the strength and length a traditional edge has, but he can still pass rush at a high level. He has a shot to be an all pro type player if he can hold up to NFL physicality.
EDGE Tyree Wilson Texas Tech 85
info: 50 pressures 8 sacks 37 tackles 72.8 RDEF 79.9 PRSH. 6'6 271 with 35 5/8 arms. Wilson was a 3 star recruit out of Henderson TX where he was his districts defensive MVP. He initially chose Texas A&M where he played his freshman year before transferring to Texas Tech. He played well over the next 3 years developing into the teams best DL and capped his senior year off with 8 sacks and All American honors.
pros: Great size and length, at 6’6 280 with 35+ inch arms he is a great edge build. Steady improvement every year. Don’t try to block him with a TE, he will dominate him physically. Has a nice long arm and an inside swim.
cons: Never was a star pass rusher, maxing out at 8 sacks. Not a great athlete, not much explosion off the ball or natural power. Can’t win around the edge, the speed and bend isn’t there.
take: Wilson is an impressive looking edge defender that plays with good strength and effort. He’s missing the athleticism you look for in a edge defender, he wont threaten the edge on NFL tackles and will have to really lean on his length. He should be able to start immediately but his ceiling isn’t as high as you would like.
EDGE Myles Murphy Clemson 85
info: 34 pressures 6 sacks 22 tackles 72.8 RDEF 78.5 PRSH. 6'5 268 with 33 3/4 arms. Murphy was a 5 star recruit out of Marietta GA where he had offers from everywhere. After a dominated HS career he joined DJ and Bresee enrolling at Clemson to join the power house up and coming program. He showed out his freshman year getting 5 sacks and being named a freshman All American. He followed his amazing freshman season up with back to back All ACC selections and getting 15 sacks over those 2 years.
pros: The perfect edge build, an athletic 6’5 275. Graded 79 and above all 3 years of college, never even played average. 5 star recruit true junior, he has potential. Great burst off the line, can get up field in a hurry. Shows good bend, can rip and get to the edge with his athleticism. Has good power to his game, devastating long arm and can walk guys back with his length and strength.
cons: His grade dropped every year instead of showing improvement. ND LT ate his lunch, his hand fighting is under developed and will get beat by good technique every time. Can get beat when it's time to make the play because of lack of agility, needs to be a finisher.
take: Murphy is a lot like Walker from last year, he’s the prototypical edge player but is lacking development. Murphy has all the athletic traits you look for, the size, length, strength and athleticism to be a top DE in the league. He just needs to get in his bag and learn pass rush moves and the little things about playing DE and he will be an All Pro player.
EDGE Will Mcdonald Iowa St 80
info: 25 pressures 6 sacks 27 tackles 70.7 RDEF 84.1 PRSH. 6'4 245 with 34 7/8 arms.
pros: Great length, at 6’3 he has 35 inch arms. 4 straight years of 6+ sacks, great production. Had a 13 sack year in 2021, he has the pass rush pedigree. Lead the nation in pass rush win rate in true pass set situations. Great athlete for the position, can explode off the line and change direction well.
cons:  A tad undersized at 6’3 240, ideally he would put on 10 more pounds. Not very strong, can get pushed around in the run game.
take: Mcdonald is a very good pass rusher that has the production to back that up. He’s a long armed and good athlete that can give tackles trouble in the pass game. He seems to be a pass rush only kind of player though, he has a slim build and never wows you with power.
EDGE Derick Hall Auburn 78
info: 47 pressures 8 sacks 43 tackles 61 RDEF 82.2 PRSH. 6'3 254 with 34 1/2 arms.
pros: Great length, 6’3 252 with 34.5 inch arms. 3 straight years of 80+ PFF pass rush grades. The best long arm in the class, can do either hand and walk tackles back. Good motor and is always trying to get to the QB. Has a solid get off and can get to the edge because of it.
cons: Not much of a run defender, too many plays where he needs to be more physical and make a play. One trick pony, he has a long arm and that is it.
take: Hall is a powerful long edge defender that uses his strengths well. He has a lethal long arm move and can get off the block to finish the play on the QB. He’s only average in the run game though where he can lose the runner too easy and not make the play on them. He’s a sure fire NFL edge player, how good he can be is up to the continued development to set up his long arm even better.
EDGE Zach Harrison Ohio St 78
info: 33 pressures 6 sacks 18 tackles 78.4 RDEF 85.2 PRSH. 6'5 274 with 36 1/4 arms.
pros: Great size at 6’6 272 as well as a 5 star recruit. Never graded poorly and had 3 straight 85+ PRSH grades. 91.1 PRSH grade on true pass sets with a 27.7 win rate. 35.75 inch arms, he’s freaky long. Strong in the run game, can keep tackles off him and set an edge.
cons: Tight hips and can’t bend an edge well. Not consistent firing off the ball, if he doesn’t jump the snap he’s a tad slow off the ball. Not much of a pass rush plan, he only uses power and a swim.
take: Harrison is made in a lab physically to play edge, the 6’6 270 pound defender. He has the strength, long arms and violent hands to be a starter in the league. He may not be quick enough or have enough bend to be a top tier edge but he certainly can start in the league.
EDGE BJ Ojulari LSU 77
info: 49 pressures 9 sacks 35 tackles 70.9 RDEF 81.5 PRSH. 6'2 248 with 34 1/4 arms.
pros: Brother of Azeez who was a second-round pick for the Giants. True junior, will just turn 21 before the draft and already as near 2,000 SEC snaps. Wore number 18 at LSU representing a high character player. Great burst off the edge, he is a serious threat to beat tackles up the field. Quick and violent hands, can swim past a tackle easily. Very good athlete that plays with a high motor to chase down plays. Has nice counters to moves already and is relentless when he’s rushing. Has good rush technique, whether that be a dip and rip or an swim/spin.
cons: May not have the ideal size, he looks a little slim on tape, at 6’3 250 would like to be a tad bigger. Needs to win with speed but his bend isn’t at the elite level you would like to see. Power in the run game will be an issue especially early on.
take: Ojulari will open his career as a pass rush specialist. He’s a great athlete that already has the moves to get to the QB and the motor to chase down plays. He’s on the smaller side which will limit him on early/run downs but the pass rushing upside it there.
EDGE Felix Anudike-Uzomah Kansas St 77
info: 46 pressures 8 sacks 34 tackles 74.6 RDEF 73 PRSH. 6'3 255 with 33 1/2 arms.
pros: True junior, played at a very high level as a true sophomore. Has the size, speed and strength to play edge in the NFL. Has won around the edge and has won with power rushes.
cons: Didn’t improve or follow up on a great 2021 season. Not a great athlete, lacks the bust you would like to see out of an edge. Good tackles get their hands on him easily and the rep is over.
take: Anuike-Uzomah looks like an NFL edge, he would not be out of place on an NFL field. I struggle to see his upside though, better competition can shut down his pass rush and he’s lacking the top end traits. He could be a solid starter in the NFL but that is probably his ceiling.
EDGE Isaiah Foskey Notre Dame 76
info: 33 pressures 12 sacks 26 tackles 67.8 RDEF 73.1 PRSH. 6'5 264 with 34 arms.
pros: Team captain for Notre Dame. Solid size at 6’5 262 and 33.75 inch arms. Good athlete, can get around the edge and bend to make a play. Solid hands, will swipe hands off him and try to re fit to get good leverage.
cons: Plays with poor balance, on the ground too often. Not a very powerful edge player, won’t bull many tackles and may get pushed in the run game.
take: Foskey has the makeup of a good edge rusher. He’s a 6’5 260 pound team captain with multiple 10 sack seasons. He’s missing the top level ability that is what you look for in high ceiling players, but he’s got good ability and should be an impact NFL player.
EDGE Tuli Tuipulotu USC 76
info: 56 pressures 13 sacks 25 tackles 75.9 RDEF 81.2 PRSH. 6'3 266 with 32 1/4 arms.
pros: True junior with back to back 82 PFF grades. Has some nice pass rush moves from both the edge an interior, has a nice jump swipe and wins to the outside. Violent hands in the pass game, can swim and throw guys well. Good blend of athleticism and size, can’t teach that.
cons: A little bit of a tweener, 6’4 270 he played a lot of edge in college. Won’t hold up to the run well in the interior. Wont threaten NFL tackles with speed.
take: Tuipulotu is a bit of a tweener, he’s too small to hold up well in the interior and not a good enough athlete for edge only. That being said a team can work to get him in a more defined role and he already has the ability to play both.
EDGE Yaya Diaby Louisville 75
info: 36 pressures 10 sacks 16 tackles 69.2 RDEF 73.2 PRSH. 6’3 263 with 33 7/8 arms.
pros: Good size with great athleticism. Amazing chase down ability, he can get home and take down the QB. Solid rip move to get hands off him and up field. Good power on contact to get into the pads of the OL.
cons: Not a refined rusher, he doesn’t have a plan. Played over the tackle which will be an adjustment to the edge. Needs to refine his hand usage in run and pass game.
take: NA
EDGE Andre Carter Army 75
info: 23 pressures 4 sacks 30 tackles 72.2 RDEF 80.8 PRSH. 6'7 256 with 33 3/8 arms.
pros: Great build, 6’6 252 with 34 inch arms. Has a solid get off that threatens tackles vertically. Works hard to get around the edge and make a play on the QB, high motor. Nice counters already in his game without much coaching I’m assuming. Great overall athlete, can change direction, bend and accelerate at a top tier level.
cons: Played at army so wasn’t seeing great competition. Clearly still needs to be coached on the run game, needs to improve to be able to play against NFL comp. Plays high too often, he got away with it but needs to lower his pads.
take: Carter is an interesting prospect, he’s a physical freak that is still pretty raw even though he racked up over 10 sacks in 2021. He can move at an elite level for his size but the strength and level of competition can be concerning. With coaching and continued physical development Carter could be an All Pro edge player.
EDGE Colby Wooden Auburn 74
info: 35 pressures 6 sacks 33 tackles 67.9 RDEF 71.8 PRSH. 6’4 273 with 33 ¾ arms.
pros: Good size for the edge, has the length and a solid size. Has the strength to play the run on the interior. Solid hands in the pass game, can get hands off him. High effort player, wants to make plays in the backfield. Seems to be a hard worker per coaches, wants to be great.
cons: For an edge he is not a good athlete, doesn’t have the speed or bend. Not great off the ball just average.
take: NA
EDGE Byron Young Tennessee 74
info: 42 pressures 9 sacks 21 tackles 56.9 RDEF 67.6 PRSH. 6’2 248 with 32 1/8 arms.
pros: Good athlete, gets off the ball well and moves well in space. 15 sacks in the last 2 years, good production. Has good bend and gives great effort around the edge.
cons: No length to him, he has 32 inch arms and is 6’2. Not many rush moves, his hands don’t help him win pass rushes. Not the best against the run, gets pushed around too much.
take: Young is a pass rush specialist that has racked up 15 sacks in 2 years. He’s a high motor player and has good bend with a violent rip to be a good pass rusher. He’s missing the attributes to make him a high level player like power and length but he’s a solid rusher.
EDGE KJ Henry Clemson 74
info: 53 pressures 5 sacks 31 tackles 78.8 RDEF 84 PRSH. 6’4 250 with 33 arms.
pros: Solid size at 6’4 250. Former 5 star recruit. Good get off and aggressive into the OL. Solid power, doesn’t get pushed around. Good at spilling run plays and taking on pullers.
cons: One year of good play as a 5th year at Clemson. Not great in coverage, doesn’t have good feel. Pass rushing is nearly all effort and clean up. Athleticism will be negated at the NFL level.
take: NA
EDGE Jose Ramirez Eastern Michigan 73
info: 50 pressures 10 sacks 38 tackles 80.1 RDEF 90.5 PRSH. 6’2 242 with 32 ¾ arms.
pros: Very good athlete with very fluid movement skills. Has a very good dip and rip move. Has some power to his rushes, can use a long arm well.
cons: Not a good size, 6’2 sub 33 inch arms and only 240. Didn’t play the best competition, beat up bad tackles. Unknown if he can stack blocks and set the edge.
take: Pass rush specialist.
EDGE Viliami Fehoko San Jose St 73
info: 66 pressures 12 sacks 35 tackles 87.4 RDEF 90.2 PRSH. 6’4 276 with 33 arms.
pros: Well built edge, strong at 276. Back to back 88+ pass rush grades. Refined pass rusher, has a spin double hand swipe and rip to win.
cons: Played a lot of lower level competition. Not the best athlete, doesn’t threaten the outside rush. Wish he showed more power in the run game.
take: NA
EDGE Nick Herbig Wisconsin 73
info: 34 pressures 11 sacks 30 tackles. 75.9 RDEF 91.1 PRSH. 6’2 240 with 31 ¼ arms.
pros: Young player that has produced 2 straight years. Some of the best get off and dip and rip ability.
cons: No length with sub 32 inch arms and 6’2. Pass rush only, wont hold up against the run in the NFL.
take: Good pass rush specialist.
EDGE Nick Hampton Appalachian St 73
info: 26 pressures 9 sacks 18 tackles 74.5 RDEF 85.3 PRSH. 6’2 236 with 33 5/8 arms.
pros: Good college production, 3 straight 80+ pass rush grades. Moves so fluid on the field, can cover and chase down plays. Top tier pass rusher, can get off the ball and bend the edge well.
cons: Not a big edge, may be a pass rush specialist. May struggle holding an edge more of a move LB that can rush.
take: NA
EDGE Robert Beal Georgia 72
info: 26 pressures 3 sacks 23 tackles 64.3 RDEF 65.9 PRSH. 6’4 247 with 34 5/8 arms.
pros: Good potential with his size and athleticism. High effort player that plays 100 mph all the time. Good counter moves, can quickly win to the inside.
cons: Couldn’t find a starting job until injuries hit in 2022. Doesn’t have the best pass rush moves, more of an athlete than a rusher. Not the strongest against the run, will have problems setting edges.
take: NA
EDGE Brenton Cox Florida 72
info: 21 pressures 2 sacks 18 tackles 66.1 RDEF 68.7 PRSH. 6’3 254 with 33 ¼ arms. Cox was a 5 star big time recruit comming out of Stockbridge GA where he could go wherever he wanted in college. Somehow he didn't accept Syracuses offer and he chose Ohio State before flipping his commitment to Georgia to play along side all the talent that they brought in on defense that year. As a true freshman at georgia he made good contributions with a 74 PFF grade. He transfered fro Georgia to Florida after seeing all the talent on the edges there and began to play for the Gators in 2020 and had his best season with 48 pressures and a 80 PFF grade. He was good for the Gators but a huge red flag happened halfway through the 2022 season where he was dismissed from the team for punching a Georgia RB and other undisclosed issues.
pros: 5 star recruit with flashes of why he was that caliber recruit. Very good athlete, quick off the ball and has quick hands. Has power to his game, can hold an edge and long arm Tackles. Has a really good pass rush repertoire.
cons: Off field concerns, suspended from the team and had to leave Georgia. Length isn’t great, can get OL hands on him a little too easy.
take: Cox would be a top 50 player if the off field issues were gone. He’s a great athlete with good power and quick hands, that allows him to rush the passer at a high level. If he gets into no more trouble Cox may become a top level edge rusher.
EDGE Isaiah Mcguire Missouri 72
info: 35 pressures 7 sacks 29 tackles 74.3 RDEF 81.8 PRSH. 6’4 268 with 33 7/8 arms.
pros: Good size and length. Good power and pop to his game, can stand up blockers. Strong hands, will rip through to get off blocks.
cons: Power only player, not going to win with any speed. Uses hands, but not efficiently, doesn’t win with them. Loses his gap in the run game too much.
take: NA
EDGE DJ Johnson Oregon 71
info: 28 pressures 5 sacks 20 tackles 66.3 RDEF 72.3 PRSH. 6’4 260 with 33 ¼ arms.
pros: Solid size at 6’4 260. Great athlete, has amazing straight line speed off the ball. Worst case he can be a special teams player.
cons: Only one year of production in 5 seasons. Not a shifty player, very linear athlete. Not much bend to speak of.
take: Great athlete, can play special teams at least.
EDGE Eku Leota Auburn 71
info: 18 pressures 4 sacks 12 tackles 72.8 RDEF 83 PRSH. 6’3 252 with 33 ½ arms.
pros: Good speed off the ball and has a nice speed move to the edge. Solid strength, can hold up in the run game. Good change of direction to go back under blocks.
cons: Missed the second half of the season. Doesn’t have a trump card, he’s a good athlete but not great.
take: NA
EDGE Mike Morris Michigan 70
info: 37 pressures 9 sacks 13 tackles 69.7 RDEF 86.6 PRSH. 6’5 275 with 33 1/2 arms.
pros: Young player with good size at 6’6 275. Powerful edge, he can set an edge and play a little bit inside. Has a bull rush and can’t be blocked with a TE or RB.
cons: Awful athlete for an edge, needs to become an interior DL. Only 725 career snaps, not very experienced. He will have a hard time against OT’s, power isn’t to that level and not an advanced rusher.
take: NA
EDGE Dylan Horton TCU 70
info: 48 pressures 10 sacks 31 tackles 74.6 RDEF 71.4 PRSH. 6’4 257 with 33 1/8 arms.
pros: Good power, can hold up to doubles. Good leverage, can put hands on guards and drive them back.
cons: Doesn’t have rush moves, just a power rusher. Not a good athlete, wont get the edge on any OT. No quickness to his game, counters and block shedding don’t happen fast.
take: NA

pros: Great length, 35 inch arms and a good build. Has some nice pass rushes where he uses his length.

info: 43 pressures 11 sacks 39 tackles 87.6 RDEF 76.4 PRSH. 6’2 262 with 33 ¼ arms.
pros: 18 sacks over the last 2 seasons. High effort player with solid athleticism. Powerful in the run game, can hold his own.
cons: Not ideal length. Doesn’t have the next level burst to threaten speed in the NFL. Stays on blocks too long.
take: NA.

pros: Solid size, has the build of an NFL EDGE. Powerful edge, can play the run well and take on pullers. Good at run stunts.
cons: Not a great athlete, no quickness to his game and is only ok off the ball. No pass rush plan, he runs right into lineman. No flexibility wont be able to get to the edge.
take: Gaye has the build to play edge in the NFL that’s for sure. He’s a big strong edge that can play the run well. His pass rushing needs a lot of work though, he’s a non flexible average athlete which is going to hurt his development.
EDGE Lonnie Phelps Kansas 69
