LB Jack Campbell Iowa 81
info: 83 tackles 85.6 RDEF 81.3 TACK 65.3 PRSH 92.9 COV. 6'5 250 with 32 inch arms.
pros: 2022 Butkus Award winner and an All American as well as a team captain. Made a massive jump in 2022 to become the nations top LB. Had back to back 80+ tackle seasons. Had a 92.9 coverage grade with 2 INTs, he’s a smart player that understands the game. 6’5 246, perfect MLB size. Good IQ, identifies run plays quickly to fill his gap and does a good job in the pass game finding receivers behind him. Good at meeting blockers in the hole and getting off the block to make a play.
cons: He lacks the aggressiveness in his game to make huge plays, doesn’t fly through the line to meet the RB in the backfield. Not a top end athlete, he is a little slow accelerating which hurts when he is guarding the slot.
take: Campbell is your prototypical MLB, with the great size and production you love to see at the college level. He’s missing the top end athleticism that will get you drafted in the first round but he is a good football player and should be an immediate starter.
LB Trenton Simpson Clemson 78
info: 51 tackles 70.3 RDEF 72.1 TACK 66 PRSH 63.6 COV. 6'2 235 with 32 3/8 arms.
pros: Dad was in the military so he has a great attitude. 5 star athlete that is a true junior. 6’3 235 and a great athlete, he is the prototypical LB. Moves very well on the field, makes quick movements and has the agility to bend and change direction. Top level testing numbers, as good an athlete you will get at LB. When he recognizes a play he bursts to it and can finish any play.
cons: Didn’t live up to the 5 star and physical attributes. Didn’t play much true LB where he would fill gaps and play coverage from the box instead of way out in the slot. A lot of reps on the edge but he isn’t long enough or refined enough to play there. Can get toasted in man coverage, good routes beat him easily.
take: Simpson has all the talent in the world and not reason he shouldn’t be the best player on the field. Unfortunately he has never played well in a traditional linebacker mold, he’s not great in coverage and he doesn’t read plays that well. He could be a solid starter for a team but in a Devin White or Patrick Queen role, don’t ask him to play LB, make him blitz and make plays that require a top level athlete.
LB Drew Sanders Arkansas 77
info: 63 tackles 70.8 RDEF 57.2 TACK 75.3 PRSH 74.3 COV. 6'4 235 with 32 1/8 arms.
pros: 6’5 232, he’s a good MLB size. Former 5 star recruit that switched positions and graded as a 77.8 in his lone year starting in the SEC. Had 11 sacks as a LB can be a hybrid edge. Long rangy LB that can make plays sideline to sideline. Very good recognition and an aggressive LB that will blow up run plays.
cons: One year starter that couldn’t find the field at Alabama. Missed nearly 20% of his tackles in 2022. Not the best in coverage, still needs to learn route concepts so he can cover them. Not a very strong backer, a little slim so he can get moved in the run game.
take: Sanders is an interesting prospect, he has one year at off ball LB and he showed out. He’s a long fluid athlete that showed great effort and good recognition in the run game. He’s got the versatility to line up at edge as well making him a threat. If he learns more about playing off ball LB in coverage and adds some mass he can be special.
LB Daiyan Henley Washington St 77
info: 74 tackles 68.7 RDEF 90.3 TACK 75.1 PRSH 68.6 COV. 6'2 225 with 33 arms.
pros: Only missed 5 tackles in 2022. Originally was a WR so he has some real athleticism and ball skills, he had 4 INTs in 2021. Very good in man, good athlete that can cover TE’s easily. Willing to come up and hit OL and run through ball carriers. Shows the ability to slip right past blockers in the run and pass game to make plays in the backfield. Moves great for an inside LB, has great burst and good bend.
cons: 5th year senior with only one year at the FBS level. A little shoer for the position at just under 6’1, but he has decent length. Not a refined LB, can tell he’s not processing the game at the highest level yet, he’s more of an attack player.
take: Henley is an interesting prospect, he started at WR before putting some muscle on and moving the LB. He has great athleticism for the position and can immediately find a role in the NFL on pass downs for sure. If he continues to learn more and more about LB and become more instinctive he will be a great NFL LB.
LB Owen Pappoe Auburn 76
info: 75 tackles 59.5 RDEF 83.2 TACK 69 PRSH 77.2 COV. 6’0 225 with 31 ¾ arms.
pros: Unreal athlete, ran a 4.30 with 29 bench reps and 36 inch vert. Played 2,236 snaps in the SEC. Tackle machine in 2022, very solid tackler. Sifts through traffic well, sees the game develop and attacks. Hits hard in the open field, flys around.
cons: On the smaller side, only 6 foot 225. Not the best feel in zone coverage, doesn’t anticipate the route concepts. Can’t stack an OL, they eat him up in the run game.
take: NA
LB Demarvion Overshown Texas 75
info: 67 tackles 73.8 RDEF 67.7 TACK 73.9 PRSH 66 COV. 6’2 220 with 32 ½ arms.
pros: Safety convert with good athleticism. Great speed, can absolutely fly. Has good bend so he can rush a little bit. Hits hard, he will lay the boom on anyone with the ball. Good IQ, sees the game very well and plays with instincts.
cons: On the lighter side of LB’s only 220. Not many true LB reps, he doesn’t play much in the box and take on blocks. Not a sure tackler, needs to wrap up better.
take: Overshown is the definition of a heat seeking missile, if he see’s something he will fly 100 mph at it. He’s a versatile player that can line up on a lot of position and excel. The biggest problem is his size, he’s not a traditional LB and will definitely need to work on that aspect of his game.
LB Henry To’oto’o Alabama 74
info: 70 tackles 72.1 RDEF 59.8 TACK 61.4 PRSH 66.6 COV. 6'1 227 with 32 3/4 arms.
pros: Over 3000 career SEC snaps, he has seen a lot of high level football. Made a solid jump in play his final year at Bama. Fantastic football IQ, he knows what to do on every play and can anticipate plays coming. Good athlete that does a pretty good job in coverage. Can dip under OL and make plays behind the LoS.
cons: 3 career pass breakups, nearly no ball production in coverage. Never graded that well, highest was a 70 other than that he was in the 50’s. On the smaller side at under 230, he will have to bulk up a little bit more. Not the strongest, can get bullied by OL and big RBs. Sometimes can struggle locating the ball, he’s in a solid spot but cant figure out where to go from there.
take: To’oto’o is another very good Alabama LB that understands the game at a high level. He’s a solid athlete with so much experience that he wont be thrown off by the NFL game. He’s on the small side though and that shows up in his tape when he loses to guys with good power. He could become a solid starter but without the play strength it will be tough for him.
LB Dorian Williams Tulane 74
info: 97 tackles 69 RDEF 80.8 TACK 76 PRSH 87 COV. 6’1 228 with 33 ¾ arms.
pros: Good length with nearly 34 inch arms. Solid athlete, runs a 4.49 at 228 pounds. Tackle machine, 97 total tackles and 6 sacks. in 2022. Fluid in coverage, can move with anyone in coverage. Team captain. Can sift through traffic to get past blockers.
cons: Would like to see his weight go up, he’s in the 220’s. Not a strong run defender, doesn’t take on blocks well. Not strong, doesn’t knock RBs backward. Instincts are only average, he doesn’t see the game at a high level.
take: NA
LB Ivan Pace Cincinnati 73
info: 92 tackles 90.7 RDEF 78 TACK 93.3 PRSH 70.6 COV. 5’10 231 with 30 ¾ arms.
pros: Ridiculous 93 PFF grade in 2022. Amazing pass rusher, he had 12 sacks. Muscle hamster, he’s jacked and athletic. Has a nose for the ball and a killer instinct. Great at taking on blocks and evading them and finding his way to the ball.
cons: No length to his game, 30 inch arms and 5’10. Coverage wont be his strong suit. Not going to stack and shed well.
take: Pace is a dog, at the very worst he will be a special teams stud. He’s very short and can struggle because of that in coverage and stack and shedding. Besides that he’s great, he’s so strong, quick and aggressive he is what you want in a MLB.
LB Yasir Abdullah Louisville 73
info: 38 tackles 71.1 RDEF 66.2 TACK 90.8 PRSH 75.5 COV. 6’1 237 with 32 3/8 arms.
pros: Good size and solid length to go with 4.4 speed. Great pass rusher, 20 sacks over the last 2 years. Will stack an offensive lineman, he’s got some power to him.
cons: Misses too many tackles, career 13% miss rate. Played edge, he will be an off ball LB in the NFL if he plays. No experience at the position he will play in the NFL.
take: NA
LB Anfernee Orji Vanderbilt 73
info: 81 tackles 76.7 RDEF 53.9 TACK 61.3 PRSH 60.1 COV. 6’1 230 with 32 arms.
pros: 2 year SEC starter and team captain with adequate size and solid testing numbers. Plays the run well, comes down hill and can scrape over the line. Pretty good off the edge, can bend and chase down the edge.
cons: Missed 15% of his career tackles. Not great in coverage, wont make plays on the ball.
take: NA
LB Mikel Jones Syracuse 72
info: Jones was a surprise commit to Syracuse after attending IMG academy and earning a high 3 star recruit and getting offers from many top SEC schools. He immediately played as a true freshman getting 4 starts and 38 tackles. He started for the remainder of his career getting 4 INTs in 2020 and 70 tackles in 2021 along with an All ACC first team selection.
pros: Good in coverage, finds receivers in space well and reads designed screens well. Good patients and athleticism to close in fast.
cons: Not a big linebacker, weak side only.
take: 
EDGE Shaka Heyward Duke 72
info: 67 tackles 68 RDEF 79.1 TACK 63.1 PRSH 77 COV. 6’3 235 with 34 arms.
pros: Great size, 6’3 235 with long arms. Good tackler, long arms make it hand to get away. Solid athlete, moves smooth in space.
cons: Not a great instinctive player, he sits and waits a little too much. Not a thumper, wont stack offensive lineman.
take: NA
LB Noah Sewell Oregon 70
info: 40 tackles 62.4 RDEF 70 TACK 73.5 PRSH 72.6 COV. 6'2 246 with 31 5/8 arms.
pros: Brother of Penei, athleticism runs in the family. 6’2 250, he’s got great size for the position. Immediately graded as a 70 for PFF in his true freshman 2020 season. Great at taking on blocks, can stand his ground and shed them easily. Solid pass rusher, has some edge moves and is a powerful blitzer. Strong athlete that plays hard, the tools are there for him to play in the NFL.
cons: Didn’t improve in PFF grade from 2020, stayed stagnant. Not the quickest LB, change of direction and acceleration are not his selling points. Doesn’t seem to have great instincts, he wont anticipate many plays and make the top end plays elite LBs make.
take: Sewell isn’t going to be a top pick like his brother but he’s a solid football player. He’s young and has great size with solid athleticism which teams will covet. He’s not the top end LB now because he doesn’t see the game the same way top end LBs do but if he gets there he’s a future pro bowl player.
LB Micah Baskerville LSU 69
info: 69 tackles 74.2 RDEF 72.3 TACK 65.1 PRSH 64.2 COV. 6’1 2 221 with 31 ¼ arms
pros: Starter with over 2000 snaps in the SEC. Smart player, communicates to the defense pre snap. See’s the game well, reacts to plays fast.
cons: Doesn’t have ideal size in the low 220’s and not long. Doesn’t take blocks well, gets washed down the line easily. Strength and athleticism aren’t where they need to be to be a good NFL Backer.
take: NA

pros: Solid athlete that was the MLB on a top 4 team and a team captain. Solid at shooting gaps to make plays in the backfield. Good short area burst to close in on a tackle.
cons: Small build for a LB, sub 230 and under 5’11. Wont beat many blocks, gets eaten up by OL. Not very fluid in coverage.
take: NA
