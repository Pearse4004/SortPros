LB Mikel Jones Syracuse 72
info: Jones was a surprise commit to Syracuse after attending IMG academy and earning a high 3 star recruit and getting offers from many top SEC schools. He immediately played as a true freshman getting 4 starts and 38 tackles. He started for the remainder of his career getting 4 INTs in 2020 and 70 tackles in 2021 along with an All ACC first team selection.
pros: Good in coverage, finds receivers in space well and reads designed screens well. Good patients and athleticism to close in fast.
cons: Not a big linebacker, weak side only.
take:
LB Trenton Simpson 77
info:  51 tackles 70.3 RDEF 72.1 TACK 66 PRSH 63.6 COV.
pros:  5 star athlete that is a true junior. 6’3 235 and a great athlete, he is the prototypical LB. Moves very well on the field, makes quick movements and has the agility to bend and change direction. Top level testing numbers, as good an athlete you will get at LB. When he recognizes a play he bursts to it and can finish any play.
cons:  Didn’t live up to the 5 star and physical attributes. Didn’t play much true LB where he would fill gaps and play coverage from the box instead of way out in the slot. A lot of reps on the edge but he isn’t long enough or refined enough to play there. Can get toasted in man coverage, good routes beat him easily.
take:  Simpson has all the talent in the world and not reason he shouldn’t be the best player on the field. Unfortunately he has never played well in a traditional linebacker mold, he’s not great in coverage and he doesn’t read plays that well. He could be a solid starter for a team but in a Devin White or Patrick Queen role, don’t ask him to play LB, make him blitz and make plays that require a top level athlete.
