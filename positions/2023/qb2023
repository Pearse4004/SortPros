QB Brennan Armstrong Virginia 73
info: Armstrong was born in Shelby Ohio where he was a dominate QB for his HS and was a 3 star prospect after leading his team to a 13-1 record. He garnered interest from many big 10 schools even committing to Iowa State before eventually flipping his commitment to Virginia where he enrolled in the spring. He was the backup behind one of Virginias best QB’s Bryce Perkins his first 2 years where he only played in garbage time. In his redshirt sophomore year he was named the starter as well as team captain and hit the ground running, passing for 2,114 yards and running for 677. He received a 90.3 PFF grade for that year but only led the team to a 5-5 record. His redshirt junior year he took a big step in the passing game and became more efficient. He threw for 4,429 yards with a 64.7 completion percentage and a 31 TDs with 10 INTs. He improved his grade to a 91.8 and his passing grade to a 90.3 but still went 500 going 6-6. The worst case scenario happened his final year though, he got a new coach in Tony Elliot and the offense fell off a cliff as well as Armstrongs play. His grade tanked to below a 60 and threw for 2000 less yards and only 7 TDs with 12 INTs.
pros: Solid arm strength, can make a throw to anywhere on the field with relative ease. Good at throwing off platform, a lot of throws where he puts it on the money scrambling around. Good runner, is a threat with his legs but doesn’t rely on them heavily. Has shown good anticipation throws, splitting zones on the break of a receiver. Trust his receivers to make plays, not afraid to put it on the back shoulder or let his receivers box out defenders. Good accuracy to all levels, has solid touch on the deep ball and very good on intermediate routes.
cons: On the smaller side of quarterbacks, 6’2 215 and likes to run which could be worrisome. He’s a lefty and it always looks weird which doesn’t matter. Had 9 fumbles and 21 turnover worthy plays, he has to cut down on those and protect the ball. Feet need a lot of work, doesn’t like to throw off of a good platform. A lot of weird movements in the pocket, has the ball in one hand and pumps until his guy is open. Would like to see more zone manipulation so safeties can’t get a beat on it. Needs to throw with slightly better anticipation consistently, lets defenders make up ground too often. Makes terrible decisions with the ball for no reason, just can’t make some of these throws in the NFL
take: Armstrong is a mix of a back yard football player and a pro style QB. There are plenty of reps where you see him stand in the pocket and throw with solid timing, but he also has that make something happen gene in him. He has a good arm and is a good athlete but he makes some of the worst decisions with the ball that I’ve seen so that has to be cleaned up to play in the NFL.
QB Hendon Hooker Tennessee 80
info: Hooker was a 4 star recruit coming out of the DMV area with offers to nearly all the schools in area. He chose to go to the best of the schools Virginia Tech where he redshirted and then took over the staring spot a few weeks into his freshman season. He transferred to Tennessee in 2021 and took the starting spot from highly thought of QB Joe Milton and was great for the Vols. His 2021 season was fantastic and that continued into his senior year where he was in the Heisman running until his ACL non-contact injury week 12 against South Carolina. He finished his Tennessee career with 6,000 yard 58 TDs with only 5 INTs and a win over Alabama which was the first if the decade for the Vols.
pros: Doesn’t put the ball in harms way, under 2% Turnover worthy play rate in his final 2 years. Good mobility, can add to the run game as a QB as well as escape the pocket and get yards with his legs. Good quick release with good feet on almost all of his throws. Great short accuracy, screens and quick game throws are nearly perfect all the time. Put up the stats and wins in the SEC.
cons: 24 years old, one of the older prospects you will see. Doesn’t have the top-level arm talent where he can make off platform and deep throws down the sideline as well as a top level QB can. Would like to see more anticipatory throws, likes to see it open more than throw it open. Not the most precise passer when adding extra zip to the ball, can sail on him from time to time.
take: Hooker has the makeup of a top quarterback prospect, he’s a great decision make, a winner and has no big weaknesses to his game. The only issue with him as a prospect is his age and lack of trump card. He’s a good runner and has a solid NFL arm but he doesn’t have the wow plays to go at the top of the draft.
QB Will Levis Kentucky 77
info: Levis was an impressive recruit coming out of Xavier HS in Connecticut. He was the number 2 player coming out of Connecticut with a 4.0 GPA and offers to nearly every ACC and MAC school. He chose to go to the Big 10 and played for Penn State in 2018. He redshirted his first season and only got 2 starts over the next 2 years against Rutgers and Iowa. He decided to transfer because he didn’t want to sit behind Sean Clifford so he went to the SEC and chose Kentucky. He had a very good season both passing and rushing being one of Kentucky’s team captains. He put up 2,827 yards on a 66 completion percentage and 24 TDs 13 INTs along with 516 rushing yards.
pros: Well built QB, 6’3 232 pounds, he clearly puts in the work in the weight room. Not a cookie cutter QB, has a funny personality behind him (see his bio and tik toks). Good runner, adds to the offenses run game. Has the NFL arm and accuracy, he’s not great but he’s NFL caliber. Can make some really nice throws on the run, good athlete that can play out of structure.
cons: Will be 24 by the time he starts a game in the NFL. Half of his production are just screen passes and designed sweeps by the offense. Inconsistent with finding open receivers over the middle, looks to the perimeter a lot and can get stuck on one player. Struggles with pressure, passing grade drops to 51 under pressure and 65 when blitzed (2021). Doesn’t make many of the wow throws down the field and over the top of defenses. When he scrambles he immediately runs, not looking to push the ball down the field.
take: Levis has everything physically you are looking for in an NFL QB, he’s 6’3 230 of very good weight and has the arm to play in the NFL. He is a good runner who can make the throws need from him, but he’s not a fully developed QB by any means. He was protected a little by the Kentucky offense and needs to be more consistent scanning the field and understanding defenses to be a starter.
