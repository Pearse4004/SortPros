QB Bryce Young Alabama 94
info: 3,325 yards 32 TD 5 INT 64.5% 91.3 PASS 66.5 RUN. 5'10 204 with 9 3/4 hands. Young was a top 25 recruit of all time coming out of the power house HS Mater Dei where he lit up the competition leading to an offer from nearly ever power 5 team. Young Committed to Bama where he served as the backup to Mac Jones. After Mac left and was drafted in the first round Young picked up where he left off and dominated leading the Crimson Tide to an SEC championship vs the wildly talented Georgia team. He was awarded the Heisman trophy for the dominating season where he threw for 4,860 yards and 47 TDs and 7 INTs.
pros: Has the pedigree of a top level player, 5 star QB of Alabama and exceeded expectations for him. Keeps the ball out of harms way, only 2% TWP rate and 12 INTs in 931 attempts as well as 1 TWP when not pressured. Nothing looks much better than when he throws it on time and in rhythm, it’s poetry in motion. Has incredible arm talent, can make accurate throws on the run using not technique. Can throw at many different arm angles to get around defenders. Has enough athleticism to make plays on the run. Short quick release that is dangerous in the quick game. Many full field reads on his tape where he finds the 3rd receiver open. Moves well in the pocket, slips away from the defenders and finds open spaces in the pocket. He’s him, when he has the ball late and you need a score he gets it. Solid accuracy everywhere on the field.
cons: He’s very small, 5’10 sub 200 would make him a one of a kind QB at that size. Drifts way too much in the pocket, too many plays where he scrambles backwards that wont end well in the NFL. Would love to see more plays that he sets his feet and delivers a good ball with a follow through, too many just arm throws. Under pressure he never makes a good strong throw where he takes the contact and throws it normal. Doesn’t have a cannon that you want out of a top pick, not truly impressive arm strength.
take: Young is like Zach Wilson if Wilson had the pedigree and makeup of a top pick. Young has great arm talent and the intangibles that you look for in franchise QB. Sometimes you draft a guy for talent other times you draft him because he plays at a higher level than every one else, that’s exactly why you draft Young. He can be a franchise guy and lead a team to wins nearly all by himself.
QB Anthony Richardson Florida 90
info: 2,553 yards 17 TD 9 INT 53% 70.5 PASS 84.8 RUN. 6'4 244 with 10 1/2 hands. Richardson was a 4 star recruit out of Gainesville FL and decided to commit to his hometown Gators.  After Penn State and Georgia offered him he opened his recruitment back up but stayed with Florida. He barely played his true freshman year behind Trask and Emory Jones but by his second year he got some reps after Jones disappointed. He came into the 2022 season as the starter for the Gators where he flashed while throwing for 2,500 yards and 17 TDs with 9 INTs while only throwing for 53%.
pros: Doesn’t take many sacks, under a 9.2 pressure to sack rate. Has elite arm strength and can put serious velocity on a ball when needed. Has arm talent to make off platform throws down the field. Has great size and athleticism for the Position, at 6’4 240 and the running skills to be a low-end RB he is a playmaker at QB. Moves around the pocket and avoids defenders very well.
cons: Takes forever to throw the ball, 3.18 average time to throw. Only completed 53% of his passes. Has some funky mechanics when throwing, his feet need a lot of work to settle down and be on platform. Not accurate now, has issues putting the ball where he wants it and it needs to be. Not helped by the garbage gators offense but never made great reads and focused more on the one target he had in mind. Not great in a west coast scheme, he’s not a game manager that will execute an offense well now.
take: Richardson is the closest thing to Josh Allen in a while and if he succeeds it will be a similar path. He has serious accuracy concerns which can be attributed to bad technique that is fixable, if he puts the work in he has the ability to be the next great QB in the NFL.
QB CJ Stroud Ohio St 88
info: 3,684 yards 41 TD 6 INT 65.9% 89 PASS 57.7 RUN. 6'3 214 with 10 hands. Stroud was a solid recruit coming out of Rancho Cucamonga CA where he was getting some looks before the Elite 11. After dominating at the Elite 11 his stock skyrocketed up to a high 4 star recruit and committed to Ohio State to back up 1st round pick Justin Fields. He didn't play in 2020 but in 2021 and 2022 he lead the Buckeyes to the CFP as well as being named a Heisman trophy finalist. In the OSU offense he put up amazing stats throwing to 1st round picks everywhere. Over the 2 years he threw for 7,760 yards 81 TDs and 12 INTs with a 92.2 and 84.1 PFF grade.
pros: Picked apart the middle of the field all year. Has the speed to be a running threat although he doesn’t use it. People around him say he has impressive character and is a great guy. Can really push the ball down the field, strong arm and good technique. Great down the field accuracy, puts the ball in very good spots. Works at a very high level in the pocket, looks like teaching tape on how to play QB.
cons: The Ohio State offense really helped out, open 1st round pick receivers everywhere. Awful under pressure, had a 34 PFF grade which is a massive drop from normal. Non rushing threat, he has broken one tackle in his entire career. Almost nothing to like out of structure, never makes a great play like that.
take: Stroud is very very reminiscent of the OSU QBs of the past. He looks great because all the open receivers and talented receivers. There’s no out of structure plays to fall back on but him in the pocket operating the OSU offense looks fantastic. He’s got the size, arm strength and production to be a great NFL QB but we need to see if it will translate.
QB Will Levis Kentucky 86
info: 2,416 yards 19 TD 10 INT 65% 65.8 PASS 64.8 RUN. 6'4 229 with 10 5/8 hands. Levis was an impressive recruit coming out of Xavier HS in Connecticut. He was the number 2 player coming out of Connecticut with a 4.0 GPA and offers to nearly every ACC and MAC school. He chose to go to the Big 10 and played for Penn State in 2018. He redshirted his first season and only got 2 starts over the next 2 years against Rutgers and Iowa. He decided to transfer because he didn’t want to sit behind Sean Clifford so he went to the SEC and chose Kentucky. He had a very good season both passing and rushing being one of Kentucky’s team captains. He put up 2,827 yards on a 66 completion percentage and 24 TDs 13 INTs along with 516 rushing yards. His Senior year was a bit of a disappointment, his stats dropped off a bit from his junior year but he went from a 90 to 68 PFF grade.
pros: Well built QB, 6’3 232 pounds, he clearly puts in the work in the weight room. Not a cookie cutter QB, has a funny personality behind him (see his bio and tik toks). Good runner, adds to the offenses run game. Has the NFL arm and accuracy, he’s not great but he’s NFL caliber. Can make some really nice throws on the run, good athlete that can play out of structure. Solid arm strength, ball comes off the hand easy and can launch it with little effort. Great at hitting a stationary target, can get screens out and run a quick hitting offense.
cons: Will be 24 by the time he starts a game in the NFL. Half of his production are just screen passes and designed sweeps by the offense. Inconsistent with finding open receivers over the middle, looks to the perimeter a lot and can get stuck on one player. Struggles with pressure, passing grade drops to 51 under pressure and 65 when blitzed (2021). Doesn’t make many of the wow throws down the field and over the top of defenses. When he leaves the pocket, he will leave to the wrong side or just not execute a scramble well. Not very accurate, throws it high to open receivers and doesn’t throw on platform.
take: Levis has everything physically you are looking for in an NFL QB, he’s 6’3 230 of very good weight and has the arm to play in the NFL. He is a good runner who can make the throws need from him, but he’s not a fully developed QB by any means. He was protected a little by the Kentucky offense and needs to be more consistent with his ball placement and decision making.
QB Tanner Mckee Stanford 76
info: 2,949 yards 13 TD 8 INT 61.2% 75.2 PASS 55.7 RUN. 6'6 231 with 9 3/8 hands. Mckee was a 4 star recruit coming out of Centennial CA but before enrolling at Stanford he took a 2 year LDS mission in Brazil. He didn't play over Davis Mills in 2020 but he got the stating spot in 2021 and played solid with a 69 PFF grade and 2,325 yards and 15 TDs with 7 INTs.  His 2022 was similar but he did improve his grade to a 75 with 3,000 yards and 13 TDs and 8 INTs as well as being a team captain.
pros: Keeps the ball out of harms way well, only a 1.5% TWP. Good height, 6’6 can easily see over the line. Makes some great NFL throws with touch down the sideline. Solid arm strength and accuracy, probably would dominate at OSU. Had to deal with a terrible team around him, played well for circumstances.
cons: Production was meh, under 3000 yards and only 13 TDs. Takes a lot of sacks, a little uncoordinated looking. Long release, takes a little to long for the ball to come out of the hand. Plays with a narrow base a lot, he needs to be able to quickly release the ball with all the sacks he takes. Doesn’t extend plays well and make them by himself.
take: Mckee is an intriguing prospect, he is a big strong armed accurate QB with good arm strength. He’s a little like Daniel Jones which isn’t the prototype QB you look for anymore.
QB Hendon Hooker Tennessee 76
info: 3,135 yards 27 TD 2 INT 69.2% 85.3 PASS 83.7 RUN. 6'3 217 with 10 1/2 hands. Hooker was a 4 star recruit coming out of the DMV area with offers to nearly all the schools in area. He chose to go to the best of the schools Virginia Tech where he redshirted and then took over the staring spot a few weeks into his freshman season. He transferred to Tennessee in 2021 and took the starting spot from highly thought of QB Joe Milton and was great for the Vols. His 2021 season was fantastic and that continued into his senior year where he was in the Heisman running until his ACL non-contact injury week 12 against South Carolina. He finished his Tennessee career with 6,000 yard 58 TDs with only 5 INTs and a win over Alabama which was the first if the decade for the Vols.
pros: Doesn’t put the ball in harms way, under 2% Turnover worthy play rate in his final 2 years. Good mobility, can add to the run game as a QB as well as escape the pocket and get yards with his legs. Good quick release with good feet on almost all of his throws. Great short accuracy, screens and quick game throws are nearly perfect all the time. Put up the stats and wins in the SEC.
cons: 24 years old, one of the older prospects you will see. Doesn’t have the top-level arm talent where he can make off platform and deep throws down the sideline as well as a top level QB can. Would like to see more anticipatory throws, likes to see it open more than throw it open. Not the most precise passer when adding extra zip to the ball, can sail on him from time to time.
take: Hooker has the makeup of a top quarterback prospect, he’s a great decision make, a winner and has no big weaknesses to his game. The only issue with him as a prospect is his age and lack of trump card. He’s a good runner and has a solid NFL arm but he doesn’t have the wow plays to go at the top of the draft.
QB Stetson Bennett Georgia 73
info: 4,132 yards 27 TD 7 INT 68.1% 88.9 PASS 66.1 RUSH. 5'11 192 with 10 hands.
pros: Not a stranger to a big game, he won back to back national championship games. Improved every year and ended up with a 90 PFF grade in 2022. Has solid movement skills, can extend plays and find open receivers on the move. Good accuracy, can put the ball where it needs to be to protect receivers or throw them open. Doesn’t make many bad decisions, careful with the ball. Under rated tough runner, can be effective running. Throws the ball with good touch, can layer the ball in.
cons: Peaked in college, won 2 national championships and no way his luck continues. A small QB at 5’11 190 and he already is 25. Needs to throw from a better base more consistently, can slip or fade too much. The arm is only ok, he doesn’t have the power behind it of a top QB. It was easy a lot at Georgia with that much talent.
take: Bennett is going to be underrated his entire life, after being a walk on at Georgia and fighting for his spot he lead the Bulldogs to 2 national championships. He’s a good athlete with an average arm that just seems to make plays whenever is needed. He showed in 2022 he can make good decisions and deliver the ball with good timing and accuracy. He wont go in the top of the draft because physically he has no calling card but don’t be surprised if he comes in the league gets an opportunity and plays well as a starter.
QB Jaren Hall BYU 71
info: 3,162 yards 31 TD 6 INT 65.7% 82.4 PASS 72 RUN.
pros: 89 and 86 PFF grade in his 2 years starting at BYU. 52 TDs to 11 INTs in his career. Decent arm talent, can make throws on the run and has NFL arm strength. Good athlete, can get to the perimeter and escape trouble. Has some real high-level reps on his tape where he throws with the anticipation and velocity needed. Knows how to throw receivers open on the sideline with a back shoulder. Looks good in rhythm, has a solid base to him and quick feet to set and fire to his target.
cons: He will be 25 when he gets into the NFL, he took a mission trip before playing at BYU. Not the ideal size at 6’1 205, he’s on the small side. Doesn’t have the zip on the ball you would want from a project QB. Doesn’t step in his throws with pressure, scared of getting hit. Too many head scratching plays where he is just either way off accuracy wise or decision making. Get lazy sometime and drifts when he throws causing inaccurate passes.
take: Hall is a solid project QB a team should take a chance on. He’s already 25 but he’s got the arm talent and athleticism that is a hard to find together. He has moments where he looks like he could be in the top of the class so if he can be more consistent a team may find a late round gem.
QB Aidan O’Connell Purdue 70
info: 3,483 yards 22 TD 13 INT 63.7% 67.4 PASS 52 RUN.
pros: Solid size, 6’3 212. Had an incredible 2021, 90.0 PFF pass grade with a 7.8% BTT. Has decent zip on the ball, can fire it in to tight windows if needed.
cons: Dropped off in 2022, regressed back to pre 2021. His feet don’t set up to the target too much causing inaccurate passes. Makes some awful turnovers that are as bad as they get. Not much of an athlete, more like the statue QB of past.
take: O’Connell showed in 2021 that he could be an NFL starter with an unbelievable amount of big time throws. He is a solid build that has an NFL arm to go along with it. He did struggle with turnovers and bad accuracy at times which may limit his to be a career backup.
QB Jake Haener Fresno St 70
info: 2,900 yards 20 TD 3 INT 71.3% 86.2 PASS 70.2 RUN.
pros: Completed over 70 percent of his passes in 2022. Improved every year getting to an 87.9 PFF grade. Was very good in the senior bowl. Nice accuracy down the field especially on crossers. Good intangibles, coaches liked him and he’s tough.
cons: 6 foot 208, he’s not a big QB. 5th year senior that will be 24 and played at Fresno. Toesy when he throws, needs to work on that. Really bad under pressure throwing short routes, looks like he short arms it. Arm is middling for the NFL, not impressive velocity. Not much of an athlete, not going to add any thing in the run game.
take: Haener has backup written all over him, the physical ability is just not what you look for. He is accurate and smart though; he can run an offense as shown by the senior bowl. I can’t see him ever become a starter but a high end backup can be valuable.
QB Tanner Morgan Minnesota 69
info: 1,382 yards 9 TD 5 INT 66% 86.5 PASS 78 RUN.
pros: His final year he had a 90.4 PFF grade. Career 9,449 yards and 5 years with starts. Amazing feet, best I’ve seen in the class. Throws with stellar anticipation. Accurate and precise, can put the ball anywhere. Has some mobility to his game.
cons: Got benched his senior year, not sure why but he was. He’s not a big QB at 6 foot 205. Career more TWP than BTT. His arm is below NFL standards.
take: I’m putting my stamp of approval on Morgan, he has some of my favorite film to watch. His technique is outstanding and he understands the game and anticipates at a high level. If he had an NFL average arm he would be a first round pick. He has great backup written all over him and that can be very valuable.
QB Matthew McKay Elon 69
info: 2,710 yards 21 TD 4 INT 60.5% 87.2 PASS.
pros: Played at NC state before. Solid size and athlete combo, 6’4 212 and can run. Has effortless arm talent, a quick flick can be 55 yards.
cons: Only played well in the FCS. Accuracy underneath is questionable. His touch passes aren’t pretty. One read then scramble. Throws it toesy too much.
take: Mckay is a talented QB with a strong arm and effortless velocity. He’s also got size and athleticism to go with it. He’s not refined for sure, he’s got mechanical issues and isn’t a great processor. If he gets coached up he could play in the NFL.
QB Lindsey Scott Incarnate Word 69
info: 4,681 yards 59 TD 8 INT 70% 92 PASS.
pros: His stats are wild, unbelievably good. 3 straight years grading above 88.5. Has a solid arm and is good in the quick game. Good athlete, can scramble to buy time and run the ball.
cons: 5’11, he’s a very short QB. Has a tendency to throw behind the receiver. Played his worst game in the Playoffs against the best comp, not seeing open guys. Struggled mostly over the middle of the field.
take: Scott was incredibly productive in 2022, he was arguably the best QB in CFB. He’s a good athlete with a solid arm and flashes of great accuracy. He’s just too short and played in the FCS so he can’t get drafted high. He struggles over the middle like one would expect for a sub 6 foot QB but he plays a little like Russell Wilson.
QB Adrian Martinez Kansas St 69
info: 1,258 yards 6 TD 1 INT 65% 69 pass 87 run. 6’3 225.
pros: 5 year starter with 9000 career passing yards. Amazing runner, true long speed and a power run threat.
cons: Arm is questionable, strength and accuracy aren’t where they need to be. Not a real QB, all good throws aren’t in structure.
take: NA
QB Malik Cunningham Louisville 69
info: Cunningham was a 3 star recruit coming out of Park Crossing HS in Alabama where he drew intrest from a few top SEC teams befor deciding to go with Louisville. He redshirted in 2017 before getting 3 starts his red shirt freshman season in 2018 where he ran for more yards than he threw. He was the full time starter from 2019 on where he always put up some impressive numbers. between 2019 and 2021 he threw for 7,600 yards and 61 TDs and also added 2,500 rush yards as well. That 2021 season was truly impressive, he received a 91 PFF grade and passed for about 3000 yards and over 1000 rush yards. 2022 was supposed to be the year where he put himself in the top of the draft conversation but he fell short of that oly throwing for 1,567 yards and 8 TDs and 5 INTs.
pros: Running back like skills at the QB spot, on 108 attempts in 2021 he forced 51 missed tackles. Good at throwing on the run, pretty good when he escapes the pocket. Good base and throwing motion, does a good job in the pocket with his technique. Very shifty, can make LBs miss in space easily.
cons: Arm strength is mediocre, not going to look good on an NFL field. Pocket presence is not good, a lot of drifting and trying to create with his legs. Doesn't throw into windows well, not sure he trusts his arm.
take: Cunningham is a very good athlete and has put up a great season in college. But, he's a little inconsistent threw the air and doesn't have the arm to be a high end starter.
QB Clayton Tune Houston 69
info: 4,065 yards 40 TD 10 INT 67.1% 91.3 PASS 72.9 RUN.
pros: Decent size at 6’2 216. Back-to-back 91 PFF grades with a career 11,973 passing yards. Production is there, he played well in the AAC and lead Houston to a lot of wins. Has the ability to move in the pocket and get out of sacks.
cons: Played at Houston, not the highest level competition and he had a star receiver in Tank Dell. Doesn’t have that strong of an arm, really has to put a lot behind a pass to get zip.
take: Tune had a great college career with many highlights in the 5 years. He just lacks the NFL ability, his arm is ok and so is his athleticism. He may be able to compete for a backup spot but being a starter is a reach.
QB Chase Brice Appalachain St 68
info: 2,922 yards 27 TD 6 INT 74.9 PASS.
pros: Played for 3 teams in 5 years, he has experience. Good size, 6’2 237. Shows very good touch and accuracy down the field. Can play in and out of rhythm, good feet in the pocket and good arm talent off platform.
cons: Never played that well, his best years were as a backup at Clemson. Lack of college production and success.
take: Brice looked really good his last year at App State. He’s a Strong QB with some mobility and a solid arm. He can do everything you ask of him but he never really became the guy. His college career was him going from program to program and never being a top QB in the nation.
QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson UCLA 68
info: 3,159 yards 27 TD 10 INT 69.3% 68.6 PASS 73.7 RUN.
pros: Has over 10,000 career pass yards, has been playing for a while. Very good athlete, he can add to the run game. Good throwing on the run and off platform, he can make accurate throws with no base. Great pocket movement, very quick.
cons: 5th year senior that is 6’1 191. Longish inefficient release. Puts the ball in harms way too many times, doesn’t respect safeties range.
take: Thompson-Robinson is a very experienced QB with some eye opening tools. He has a solid arm to pair with great athleticism. He’s on the smaller side and struggled with decision making which is not a good combo, but he could be a very good backup.
QB Fred Payton Mercer 68
info: 3,037 yards 32 TD 8 INT 67% 93.1 PASS.
pros: 93.1 Pass grade and didn’t throw a pick through week 6. Very accurate, he knows where to put the ball to put it out of harms way. Solid movement skills to get out of the pocket.
cons: Not the strongest arm, needs to have a clean base to throw from. Off platform accuracy isn’t there, too inaccurate.
take: Payton is a nice surprise, he’s a very solid QB with ok size and athleticism but great accuracy and IQ. If his arm were up to NFL standards he would be a mid round pick but it’s just not NFL average.
QB Max Duggan TCU 68
info: Duggan was the Gatorade player of the year in Iowa and was the top QB in the state of Iowa in 2018. He had interest from a lot of big time programs like ND and OSU but chose to go to up and coming TCU to lead the horned frogs to new heights. He did just that, he has always battled through injuries but started all 4 years of his career and always played solid football. He improved his grade from a 67 to 79 to 76 all the way to 85.6 as a senior. That final year he lead TCU to its first College football playoff and was named a Heisman Finalist for his efforts. He threw for 3,320 yards 30 TDs and 4 INTs along with over 500 yards rushing.
pros: Very willing runner, not scared of contact or to make a play. He’s got grit, went through a lot of medical problems but still kept pushing through. Decent arm/size combination, he wont look out of place on an NFL field. Can throw well from multiple arm angles and is a playmaker.
cons: Wasn’t the week 1 starter, never was the guy coming into the season. Not as accurate as you would like, misses too many open throws. A lot of big 12 plays where he has a lot of time and cant find open receivers early. Doesn’t trust his arm enough, multiple NFL open throws he passes up.
take: Duggan is a great college QB that you cant help but root for. He’s got the grit you look for and can will a team to victory if needed. He’s not very accurate though and his physical ability isn’t much to fall back on if you want him to be a franchise guy. He can stick around the NFL a while as a high end back up, he’s a version of Taylor Heinike.
QB Tommy Devito Illinois 68
info: 2,643 yards 15 TD 4 INT 69.4% 81.6 PASS
pros: Played at Syracuse. Has over 10 inch hands. Played well as soon as he left cuse. Has decent arm talent, best looking passer at Cuse in a while. Has the athleticism to play on the move and scramble.
cons: 6’1 206, not ideal size. Got benched for Garrett Shrader. Scared of getting hit, breaks down when pressure is there.
take: Devito is a solid QB but he doesn’t do anything great. He’s a middle of the road athlete with average size and arm strength with one full year starting. He’s got the tools to play in the league but he’s never going to be a plus QB in the league.
QB Sean Clifford Penn St 68
info: 2,822 yards 24 TD 7 INT 64.4% 80.1 PASS.
pros: 4 year starter at a top program and got better over the years. Solid size with a good quick release. Has some mobility to his game.
cons: Never broke out and became a top QB in the nation. He is older than me, he will be 25 day 1 in the NFL. Accuracy is just fine and he doesn’t have great power on his throws.
take: Clifford is an accomplished QB with a lot of experience. He isn’t great in one area though, he’s a solid athlete with a decent arm but not what you want in the NFL. He may be able to stick around as a backup with his high character but talent wise he’s not there.
QB James Blackman Arkansas St 68
info: Blackman was a high 3 star recruit coming out of Belle Glade FL as a 6'5 165 pound project. He commited to Florida State to sit and learn behind returning starter Deondre Francois. That plan didn't happen though, Francois went down with an injury in 2017 when the seminols were 2-5 and Blackman came in and as a true freshman led them to 6-6 throwing for 58%, 2229 yards and 19 TDs with 11 INTs. He returned to the bench in 2018 but in the one game he got to play against NC State he made the most of it. He received an 88 grade with 420 Yards and 4 TDs. That earned him the staring spot in 2019 where he was named captain but it was a disapointing season where he had more tournover worthy plays than big time throws. He ws the opening starter in 2020 before a young Joran Travis took the job and didn't let it go resulting in Blackman transfering to Arkansas State. He played well at Arkanasas State where he had a combined 30 BTT and only 11 TWP.
pros: Tall 6’5 athlete that has nearly 10,000 career yards. Good arm, he can throw off platform and zip the ball in platform.
cons: He’s a twig, at 6’5 hes under 200. Not the best at reading a field, missing a lot of open receivers for jump balls or check downs. Accuracy is only ok, not putting the ball on the money much.
take: Blackman had a great start to his career at Florida State before injuries took that away from him and forced him to transfer. He’s a 6’5 athlete with a good arm and you can’t teach that. I would love him in camp to see if he can develop.
QB Austin Aune North Texas 68
info: 3,551 yards 33 TD 15 INT 56.3% 71.4 PASS.
pros: Solid stats his final year. Can put some zip on it, solid arm that could work in the NFL. Rolled out on over half his drops.
cons: 56% completion and 15 INT in 2022. Touch and accuracy are not where they need to be.
take: Aune has a good arm and is a decent athlete. He has issues with accuracy giving the ball to the other team but if he can fix that he can be an NFL QB.
QB Dylan McCaffrey Norther Colorado 68
info: 1,837 YARDS 11 TD 12 INT 59%^ 70 PASS 68 RUN. 6’5 220.
pros: Good size and recruit. Throws a pretty ball with a good base. Good mechanics in the pocket, protects the ball and can move.
cons: Couldn’t make it at Michigan and didn’t kill it at Norther Colorado.  Under pressure makes him look like a different QB.
take: NA
QB Holton Ahlers East Carolina 67
info: 3,699 yards 28 TD 5 INT 66.8% 82.6 PASS.
pros: A lot of experience, over 2000 drop backs and 13,866 yards. Good size, 6’3 237 he’s the prototypical build. Has an NFL can zip the ball in there and push it down the field. Can run a little bit, can run QB power.
cons: Never really dominated in his 5 years like you would like to see. Long slow release. Touch isn’t great, not accurate with touch throws. He’s a Lefty.
take: Ahlers is a big strong QB that has a solid arm. That’s enough to get you in the NFL but he also has a ton of experience that helps his prospects. He has the physical tools to play but he’s not refined, he needs to be more accurate and process better to be a solid NFL QB.
QB Tyson Bagent Shepherd 67
info: Played at a D2 school.
pros: Was good for a D2 QB, he won the D2 version of the Heisman. Has some solid escapability, has the quickness to move in the pocket well. Decent arm, can make NFL type throws.
cons: Not NFL ready right now, passes up a bunch of NFL open throws for check downs. Won’t be able to get away with the throws he makes on the move in the NFL. He’s not overly accurate, the precision isn’t there on his passes.
take: Bagent is a big time project, not many D2 guys even get a chance at the NFL. He has some ability but it will be an uphill climb for him to make a roster.
QB Todd Centeio James Madison 67
info: 2,682 yards 25 TD 5 INT 63.7% 87.8 PASS.
pros: Balled out in 2022 getting a 90.4 grade. Alright zip on the ball, not a noodle arm. A lot of experience in different offenses. Solid athlete, can move well and escape the pocket. Good feet in the pocket throws with a solid base.
cons: Old old, he’s been in college since 2017. Played for 3 teams and only was very good with one of them. He is short, max 6 foot. Got smoked in his one game in the power 5 4/15. Accuracy isn’t great, placement is ok and he misses too many throws.
take: Centio is a solid QB that played very well for James Madison last season. He’s a well built athlete that has a decent arm and a lot of experience. It took him 5 years to become that guy though and he still can struggle with accuracy so NFL starter is a reach. He should come in and compete for QB 3 in the NFL.
QB Tim Demorat Fordham 67
info: 4,885 yards 56 TDs 10 INT 64.8% 92.4 PASS
pros: Had an absolute absurd BTT at 10%. Big time performance in 2022, 92.5 PFF grade and over 50 TDs. Good size at 6’3 221.
cons: Only had one great year at Fordham. Arm strength is disappointing, no zip on the ball. Throwing to wide open players, not actually that accurate.
take: Demorat looks good until you watch him play. His stats are great as well as his measurables but the play is lacking. He got away with a lot of bad throws against bad competition and doesn’t make spectacular throws. He will have to battle for a practice squad spot.
QB Darren Grainger Georgia St 67
info: 2,428 yards 18 TD 7 INT 58.5% 73.5 PASS.
pros: Tall 6’4 athletic QB. He’s got a great arm, can sling it down the field.
cons: Not an efficient passer, a release isn’t that quick and isn’t a fast decision maker. Not accurate, low end of college passers.
take: Grainger is a tall strong armed athletic QB. Everything else needs a lot of work and it’s probably too much to work on to make the NFL.
QB Kyle Vantrease Georgia Southern 67
info: 4,270 yards 25 TD 16 INT 61.6% 70.4 PASS.
pros: Played a lot of football, 1,300 career drop backs. Solid at attacking down the field, he has solid touch deep.
cons: Arm isn’t that good, not much power. Not much of a runner. Going to be 25, has been playing since 2017.
take: Vantrease is a solid QB that ran the Georgia State offense well last year. He had a lot of opportunities to throw in the offense and he made some nice throws down the field. He just isn’t physically impressive, his size, athleticism and arm are all slightly below average so it will be tough for him to stick in the league.
QB Logan Bonner Utah St 67
info: 739 yards 6 TD 8 INT 56% 61.3 PASS 45.9 RUN.
pros: Solid thick build, well filled out. Good base to his game, never gets heel clicky. Solid accuracy, pretty good ball placement.
cons: Got hurt in his final year, didn’t back up his 2021 season. The offense sucked, no NFL reads.
take: NA
QB Trae Self Stephen F Austin 66
info: 2,556 yards 19 TD 4 INT 60.1% 81.1 PASS.
pros: Good runner and 6’4 200. 3 year starter that improved every year. OK arm, wont be that bad in the NFL.
cons: Career 60% completion percentage, not accurate.
take: Self is a tall athletic QB that has a solid arm but only played in the FCS. He has some good throws on tape but he’s not the most accurate which will make it tough for him if he gets a shot.
QB Ben Bryant Cincinnati 65
info: 2,744 yards 21 TD 7 INT 61.1% 84 PASS
pros: Solid size at 6’3 220. Never had a below 73 PFF grade.
cons: Only 2 years starting because of Desmond Ridder. Doesn’t have the arm strength to make tight window throws or the anticipation. Weird release, a funny arm action.
take: Bryant isn’t an NFL QB, he is too sloppy and doesn’t anticipate well enough. He’s probably not going to make a team.
QB Carter Bradley South Alabama 65
info: 3,335 yards 28 TD 12 INT 64.2% 76 PASS.
pros: Solid final year with 3000+ yards and 24 BTT. 6’3 212 isn’t a bad size.
cons: Couldn’t start for 4 years at Toledo.
take: Didn’t watch him but the resume isn’t that impressive.
QB Nkosi Perry FAU 65
info: 2,710 yards 25 TD 5 INT 58% 80.9 PASS.
pros: 6’4 athlete tha has 8000 career passing yards.
cons: He’s a twig, 6’4 and under 200. Sub 60 completion percentage, he’s not accurate. His arm is alright at best, not much zip.
take: Perry is 6’4 and a solid athlete. That’s all the good there is though, he’s not accurate and has a meh arm. He’s not going to make it.
QB Reece Udinski Richmond 65
info: 3,614 yards 29 TD 5 INT 72.5% 89.5 PASS.
pros: 6’4 220 and graded well in 2022. Accurate in the short game, doesn’t put the ball in harms way much.
cons: 4 unproductive years before breaking out. Not mobile, wont add anything with his legs. Arm is only ok, wont look good in the NFL. Doesn’t push the ball down the field.
take: Udinski looks great on paper, 6’4 220 with a 90.1 PFF grade. The tape isn’t that impressive though, he doesn’t push the ball down the field and isn’t physically gifted.
QB Myles Brennan LSU 65
info: Bench.
pros: Solid 4 star recruit and played at LSU.
cons: Quit football.
take: NA
QB Charlie Brewer Liberty 65
info: 52 yards 0 TD 1 INT 61.5% 65.2 PASS 54.7 RUN.
pros: in 2018 he had a 90 PFF pass grade. Not horrible in the quick game.

QB Chris Reynolds Charlotte 64
info: 2,525 yards 22 TD 11 INT 63.6% 80.6 PASS.
pros: 5 year starter with over 10,000 pass yards. He runs the offense well and was a former walk on.
cons: Small QB, sub 6 foot and 200 pounds. Does not have an NFL arm. Inaccurate when he puts zip on the ball.
take: Reynolds did good for himself, from a walk on to the passing record leader at Charlotte he played well his entire college career. He just doesn’t have the size or arm to play in the NFL.
QB Chase Cunningham Middle Tennessee 64
