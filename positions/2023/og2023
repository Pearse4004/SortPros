OG O’Cyrus Torrence Florida 78
info: 3,065 career snaps 89.9 RBLK 76.1 PBLK 8 pressures.
pros: Big guard at 6’5 347 and has played both sides. A lot of experience and all of it has been good play. Showed that he was as good at Florida in the SEC as he was at LA Lafayette. 0 carrier sacks allowed, has a very strong anchor and is tough to bull rush. Good power in the run game, can be a real people mover.
cons: Has very little laterally agility to his game, can struggle with quick rushers. Jalen Carter beat him pretty bad on most plays, can’t handle quickness.
take: Torrence is a massive man that plays power football at a high level. He has issues in pass protection with speed and his lack of quickness but he has the potential to clean that up. He should be able to step in immediately and play guard.
OG Steve Avila TCU 76
info: 2,297 career snaps 66.6 RBLK 83.6 PBLK 11 pressures.
pros: Great size, 6’4 330 is what you would draw a guard up as. Good power in the run game, can move people vertically. Good hands in pass pro, tight punches and good extension.
cons: Slow feet and slow to react to stunts because of it. Some head scratching missed assignments possibly. Not a athlete, more of just a big body for gap schemes.
take: Avila is a big strong lineman that can play in a phone booth. He’s not very quick and he has some mental lapses but he’s got the size and strength you can’t teach.
OG Jaxson Kirkland Washington 76
info: 3,304 snaps 73.2 RBLK 82.6 PBLK 9 pressures. 6’6 322 with 33 3/8 arms
pros: Has a good tackle build at guard and has played both. Very experienced and has graded solid for 4 straight years. Strong OL that can anchor and move people in the run game. Solid in pass pro, smooth that gets hands on and stays balanced.
cons: Older prospect that may not improve too much more. Not a great athlete, at tackle he can get exposed a little bit.
take: Kirkland is a big strong lineman that can play both guard and tackle. He is very experienced and has a great feel for the position. He may not be the best athlete but he’s good enough and can start right now.
OG Emil Ekiyor Alabama 75
info: 2,743 snaps 70.1 RBLK 79.9 PBLK 8 pressures. 6’2 317 with 33 5/8 arms.
pros: Solid athletic guard build at 6’2 317 with 33.5 inch arms. Experienced guard in the SEC with 3 very solid years of PFF grading. Good athlete that plays with good leverage. Good at picking up stunts and scanning for work.
cons: Doesn’t have the natural power to move people in the run game. Can get off balance from time to time by leaning too much.
take: Ekiyor is a starting NFL guard, when you turn on the tape you see a very solid guard that will get the job done. The reason he wont go as high is because the natural power isn’t quite there, he may struggle in gap schemes in the run game. He’s got a very good build with long arms for a guard and a good first step, I expect him to come in and start day 1.
OG Andrew Vorhees USC 75
info: 3,491 career snaps 82.5 RBLK 80.1 PBLK 15 pressures
pros: Good size, 6’6 325. Had a 90.1 grade in 2021. Decent play strength, can hold up to NFL power if needed.
cons: He came into college in 2017, he’s already 24. Took a step back in 2022 from a 90 to 81. Plays high and not always with good balance, needs to play lower and with more control. Not the best athlete, mediocre lateral quickness.
take: Vorhees is a old prospect that still needs some work. He’s got the size and strength to play but he didn’t dominate like a 6th year senior should. He can end up starting for a team at guard but he will need to continue to improve.
OG Sidy Sow Eastern Michigan 74
info: 3,633 snaps 78.4 RBLK 69.5 PBLK 17 pressures. 6’5 330.
pros: Great size and experience. 3 straight solid years of grading. Great power in the run game, can move guys off the line. Uses hands well in the pass game, flashes hands and then strikes.
cons: Didn’t play many power 5 schools. Not the most agile lineman, not quick. Sometimes can get off balance and lose his base.
take: Sow will have a talent adjustment in the NFL but being that size and having his level of experience will help. He’s a strong guard that has played well and has the ability to improve. He can get a little quicker and with more coaching develop into an impactful guard.
OG Atonio Mafi UCLA 74
info: 1,402 snaps 88.3 RBLK 70.9 PBLK 18 pressures. 6’3 338 with 32 5/8 arms.
pros: Solid size, thick build. Good run blocker, uses good leverage and power to move guys. He can run a bit, solid at pulling.
cons: One year starter. Not the best in pass pro, his feet are stuck in the ground too often and he gets ran around.
take: Mafi is a phone both star. He can drive people back and you wont get through him. He can’t play in a zone scheme and can struggle in pass pro because his lateral agility is mediocre. He could probably start immediately but needs to work on his athleticism.
OG Chandler Zavala NC St 73
info: 1,085 snaps 73.4 RBLK 86.5 PBLK 4 pressures. 6’3 322 with 33 arms.
pros: Great guard build, solid arm length and a thick build. Surprising lateral agility. Solid anchor and has good power.
cons: One year starter. Not the best athlete, he’s a waist bender that has ok feet.
take: Zavala looks like and NFL Guard. He’s a good pass protector with his long arms and solid agility. He’s not an overly physical player in the run game, he could be better there but he does enough. He should be able to start immediately and become a solid starter.
OG Nick Broker Ole Miss 72
info: 3,323 career snaps 62 RBLK 72.8 PBLK 19 pressures.
pros: Played both OG and OT. Solid enough athlete to pull and do anything you ask of him. Good technician, always engaging the defenders chest and trying to drive them. Works hard in the run game, will run his feet to stay on the block.
cons: 32 inch arms, not a very long player. Never graded above 70, was never a dominate OL. His strength is an issue, he fits defenders well but can’t move them and can struggle anchoring. High level defenders can toy with him, he’s just not a good NFL athlete.
take: Broeker plays hard and is solid with his technique. He has physical limitations that will hinder the level of his play to a high end back up to low end starter at best.
OG Anthony Bradford LSU 73
info: 1,103 snaps 70 RBLK 51.7 PBLK 12 pressures. 6’4 340.
pros: Massive guard, he is very thick. Has started a game at LT. Has a very good anchor, can stop a bull rush easily. Moves well for his size.
cons: One year starter, not much experience. Seems to not be 100% on what he’s doing all the time. Not very agile, lets guys slip by him too often.
take: Bradford is a massive guard who’s game is power. He’s not a blob either, he can move well for that size. He’s just not experienced and lacks some agility.
OG Jarrett Patterson Notre Dame 72
info: info: Patterson was a highly sought after recruit coming out of Mission Viejo in California. He choose to attend Notre Dame and put together a very nice career there. He was the starter his sophomore year and on for a dominate Notre Dame offensive line. His final year he was named a captain and acted as a leader for the team all year.
pros: 2 time Notre Dame team captain, he’s a leader with great experience. Great at picking up stunts and passing them off, very smooth in pass pro. Gives good effort in the run game and stays on his blocks.
cons: Short short arms, sub 32 inches. Took a step back in grading after switching to guards from center. Lacking the anchor/power to play high level guard, best position is center. Could work on his pad level, can let defenders get under him too often.
take: Patterson is a guy you want on your team, he’s a smart leader that has played a lot of football. He’s not going to wow you physically but he will be able to step in and not be overwhelmed by the NFL.
OG Henry Bainivalu Washington 69
info: 2,233 snaps 65.9 RBLK 79.5 PBLK 13 pressures. 6’6 312 with 34 ¼ arms
pros: Has a good tackle build at guard. A lot of experience at RG. Solid athlete, can get to and play in space.
cons: Not the best strength, doesn’t move many guys. Can get beat bad by keeping his feet in the ground.
take: Bainivalu was a solid RG for Washington the last 3 years, he’s a good size and a solid athlete. He gets beat too badly too often to be a high draft pick, his strength and balance will limit him.
OG Jovaughn Gwyn South Carolina 71
info: 3,195 snaps 65.2 RBLK 76 PBLK 19 pressures. 6’3 300.
pros: 4 years starter in the SEC. Good athlete with good flexibility. Solid in pass pro, he is smart and uses his hands well.
cons: On the smaller side for an offensive lineman. Not a people mover, wont create vertical movement in the run game.
take: Gwyn is an experienced guard that is a plus athlete at the position. He is very smart and is a solid pass protector that can handle one on ones. He’s just not a plus run blocker because he lacks that power you look for.
OG Spencer Anderson Maryland 69
info: 2,379 snaps 55.1 RBLK 79.8 PBLK 15 pressures. 6’5 305 with 32 ¾.
pros: Has solid athleticism to be able to reach DL and get to backers. Smooth in pass pro, doesn’t get too off balance.
cons: No special to his game, not high end at anything.
take: Anderson won’t pop off the screen when you watch him and that’s good and bad. He’s a solid run and pass blocker but he wont dominate anyone especially in the NFL. He can be a great NFL backup that you can win games with.
OG Tashawn Manning Kentucky 69
info: 1,878 snaps 68.6 RBLK 77.6 PBLK 11 pressures. 6’4 330.
pros: Big man, good guard build. Overcame cancer in 2016. Good power and anchor.
cons: Transferred from Auburn so he could start. Sloppy feet and hand usage. Not much of an athlete.
take: If you saw Mannings weight it would tell you all you need to know. He’s a pure gap scheme guy with the ability to move people and anchor in pass pro. He’s carrying some bad weight so he’s not the most fleet of foot. If he gets in better shape and cleans up his technique he could be a good guard.
OG Jon Gaines UCLA 68
info: 2,384 snaps 76.7 RBLK 77.4 PBLK 18 pressures. 6’3 300.
pros: Had a breakout 2022 where he graded pretty well. Versatile, he has snaps at all of the position. Good athlete, very fast off the ball.
cons: On the smaller side for a lineman. Lacks the power and length to anchor or create movement in the run game.
take: Gaines is a very athletic guard that works hard in the run game to create lanes. He’s on the smaller side though and he doesn’t have much power which will hurt his chances to stick around in the NFL.
OG Joey Fisher Shepherd 67
info: 6’4 295 32 inch arms.
pros: D2 all American first team.
cons: Undersized.
take: I can’t find shepherd film, he’s probably a big project.
OG Brent Laing Minnesota-Duluth 67
info: 6’3 298 with 32 1/4 arms.
pros: Was good against lower competition.
cons: Got smoked at the east west game. Doesn’t have much strength to anchor or move guys in the run game.
take: Laing played at a low level college and when he played in the east west bowl he got exposed. He doesn’t have the power or athleticism to succeed in the NFL tight now.
OG Jerome Carvin Tennessee 66
info: 2,817 snaps 52.2 RBLK 56 PBLK 12 pressures. 6’4 308 with 33 3/8 arms.
pros: 42 game starter with experience at all 3 interior positions. Solid technique, hands are usually good.
cons: Bad athlete, so slow off the ball. The power isn’t there, he can’t anchor.
take: Carvin is an experienced guard with a lot of SEC experience. He’s just an awful athlete and can’t play in the NFL.
