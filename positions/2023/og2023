OG O’Cyrus Torrence Florida 77
info: 3,065 career snaps 89.9 RBLK 76.1 PBLK 8 pressures.
pros: Big guard at 6’5 347 and has played both sides. A lot of experience and all of it has been good play. Showed that he was as good at Florida in the SEC as he was at LA Lafayette. 0 carrier sacks allowed, has a very strong anchor and is tough to bull rush. Good power in the run game, can be a real people mover.
cons: Has very little laterally agility to his game, can struggle with quick rushers. Jalen Carter beat him pretty bad on most plays, can’t handle quickness.
take: Torrence is a massive man that plays power football at a high level. He has issues in pass protection with speed and his lack of quickness but he has the potential to clean that up. He should be able to step in immediately and play guard.
OG Andrew Vorhees USC 75
info: 3,491 career snaps 82.5 RBLK 80.1 PBLK 15 pressures
pros: Good size, 6’6 325. Had a 90.1 grade in 2021. Decent play strength, can hold up to NFL power if needed.
cons: He came into college in 2017, he’s already 24. Took a step back in 2022 from a 90 to 81. Plays high and not always with good balance, needs to play lower and with more control. Not the best athlete, mediocre lateral quickness.
take: Vorhees is a old prospect that still needs some work. He’s got the size and strength to play but he didn’t dominate like a 6th year senior should. He can end up starting for a team at guard but he will need to continue to improve.
OG Steve Avila TCU 74
info: 2,297 career snaps 66.6 RBLK 83.6 PBLK 11 pressures.
pros: Great size, 6’4 330 is what you would draw a guard up as. Good power in the run game, can move people vertically. Good hands in pass pro, tight punches and good extension.
cons: Slow feet and slow to react to stunts because of it. Some head scratching missed assignments possibly. Not a athlete, more of just a big body for gap schemes.
take: Avila is a big strong lineman that can play in a phone booth. He’s not very quick and he has some mental lapses but he’s got the size and strength you can’t teach.
OG Nick Broker Ole Miss 72
info: 3,323 career snaps 62 RBLK 72.8 PBLK 19 pressures.
pros: Played both OG and OT. Solid enough athlete to pull and do anything you ask of him. Good technician, always engaging the defenders chest and trying to drive them. Works hard in the run game, will run his feet to stay on the block.
cons: 32 inch arms, not a very long player. Never graded above 70, was never a dominate OL. His strength is an issue, he fits defenders well but can’t move them and can struggle anchoring. High level defenders can toy with him, he’s just not a good NFL athlete.
take: Broeker plays hard and is solid with his technique. He has physical limitations that will hinder the level of his play to a high end back up to low end starter at best.
