S Brian Branch Alabama 85
info: 74 tackles 2 INT 90.7 RDEF 91.8 TACK 86.4 COV.
pros: True junior that played all 3 years for Alabama. Only missed 4 tackles in his career. Got better every year and had a 89.5 grade in 2022. Great burst, when he see’s something he goes from 0 to 100 real quick. Great IQ, see’s the game well and is versatile.
cons: On the slimmer side for a safety at under 200 pounds. Didn’t play much deep safety, mostly a box safety. Needs to add strength, strong ball carriers can gain extra yards on him.
take: Branch is a very very good football player that will fit on any team. He’s a smart player that can play in the box at a high level and is very aggressive tackling. He will be an NFL starter immediately and could become a top safety in the league.
S Jordan Battle Alabama 78
info: 42 tackles 1 INT 72.5 RDEF 77.3 TACK 85.2 COV.
pros: 4 year starter at Alabama and is 6’1 205, he looks the part. Graded above 80 for the past 3 years. Seems to always be in a solid position, never blowing coverages.
cons: He’s not the top tier athlete that gets drafted very high. Missed too many tackles in his career. Not a great man cover player, the athleticism is lacking.
take: Battle is an NFL safety, the world has know that for 3 years now. He’s so solid that he’s as high a floor prospect as you can get, he’s smart and has the physical ability to play in the NFL. He will be a starter for many years in the league.
S Antonio Johnson Texas A&M 77
info: 55 tackles 0 INT 83.7 RDEF 70.2 TACK 79.7 COV.
pros: True junior that is 6’3 200. Had an 87.4 grade in 2021 as a true junior. Good in the box figuring out what the offense is doing. Physical player, will bring the hit stick with him.
cons: Only 1 INT in 800 coverage snaps. Awful wrap up tackler, will struggle in the NFL. Not the fluid middle of the field safety. Unknown if he can play the ball well.
take: Johnson is an aggressive box safety that wants to hit. He does a great job finding his way to the ball carrier and putting big hits on them. If he can add good coverage to his game he will be a legit pro bowl safety.
