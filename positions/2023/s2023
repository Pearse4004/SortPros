S Brian Branch Alabama 84
info: 74 tackles 2 INT 90.7 RDEF 91.8 TACK 86.4 COV.
pros: True junior that played all 3 years for Alabama. Only missed 4 tackles in his career. Got better every year and had a 89.5 grade in 2022. Great burst, when he see’s something he goes from 0 to 100 real quick. Great IQ, see’s the game well and is versatile.
cons: On the slimmer side for a safety at under 200 pounds. Didn’t play much deep safety, mostly a box safety. Needs to add strength, strong ball carriers can gain extra yards on him.
take: Branch is a very very good football player that will fit on any team. He’s a smart player that can play in the box at a high level and is very aggressive tackling. He will be an NFL starter immediately and could become a top safety in the league.
S Jordan Battle Alabama 78
info: 42 tackles 1 INT 72.5 RDEF 77.3 TACK 85.2 COV.

cons: He’s not the top tier athlete that gets drafted very high. Missed too many tackles in his career. Not a great man cover player, the athleticism is lacking.
take: Battle is an NFL safety, the world has know that for 3 years now. He’s so solid that he’s as high a floor prospect as you can get, he’s smart and has the physical ability to play in the NFL. He will be a starter for many years in the league.
