RB Bijan Robinson Texas 84
info: Robinson was a HS All American where he won the Ed Doherty award (Top Arizona HS player) two years in a row. He had 114 TDs in high school which is a state record and those accolades lead to a high 5 star label with offers from many top programs. He chose Texas over all of them and immediately made an impact running for 700 yards with 8.1 YPC. His second year he took over the full time starting spot and ran for 1,127 yards with a 91.1 PFF run grade and 79 MTF. If that wasn't good enough he came back better than ever, He ran 1,575 yards 18 TDs with 4.17 yards after contact and 1004 MTF. All of that lead to a 96 run grade and a Doak walker award.
pros: Unreal short area quickness, could actually make a defender miss in a phone booth. Very good athlete, can run away in the open field and hit home runs. Good size and strength, can muscle his way through a defender when he needs to and always go forward. Great contact balance, very strong lower half that allows him to eat contact and keep going. Has great instincts when he has the ball, knows where defenders are and the best way to make them miss. Solid hands, shown the ability to make non trivial catches.
cons: Doesn’t have the best vision for and ability to set defenders up to be blocked. Only ok in pass pro, nothing special. Dances a little too much that can cause 4 yard gains to be 0.
take: Robinson is one of the most talented backs ever to enter the draft. There aren’t many flaws in his game, if anything he needs to learn how to slow down and be more decisive. He will immediately become a teams star RB and play very well from day 1 in the NFL
RB Jahmyr Gibbs Alabama 78
info: Gibbs was a 3 star coming out of Dalton GA initially before leading the state in rushing with 2,554 rushing yards an 40 TDs as a senior. He got bumped up to a 4 start and got offers from the SEC power houses but stayed commited to Georgia Tech. For some reason he was a rotation piece for GT in his first 2 years rushing for a combined 1,200 yards and 8 TDS before transfering to Bama where he was their lead back.  He iwas an impact player for Bama and ran for over 920 yards and 7 TDs as a true junior with 0 fumbles to go with it.
pros: Home run hitter at RB, with a 6.2 YPC and 52.5% of his yards coming on break away runs he is dangerous to take any carry to the house.  He's a solid receiver, with an 82.3 receiving grade and only 2 career drops he can be dangerous out of the backfield. Runs crisp routes, is a problem when he has an option route against a LB. Elite athlete at RB, great speed to go along with being twitchy. Breaks 1 on 1 open field tackles easily.
cons: Struggled in pass pro at bama receiving a 24 PFF grade in 2022. Doesn’t have the best running style, a lot of big plays or a short gain. Isn’t patient and not decisive, he doesn’t set up blockers well and hit holes with conviction. Likes to bounce to the outside too often.
take: null
RB Zach Charbonnet UCLA 77
info: Charbonnet was a top 50 recruit coming out of Oaks Christian in Westlake Village CA. He committed to Michigan where he flashed before leaving when Blake Corum came into town with Hassan Haskins. He transferred to UCLA where he was their number one back and ran for over 1000 yards back to back years and 90 PFF grades. He finished his career as a first team all Big 12 RB and a top RB in the nation.
pros: Breaks tackles at a high level forcing 121 missed tackles in his 2 years as a starter. Prototypical back, he's 6'1 220 and is a good athlete that can play on all 3 downs. 2 fumbles in 566 career attempts. Production is outstanding, in 2021 he ran for 1,358 Yards 7.0 YPC and 14 TDs. Surprising wiggle for a big back like himself, can shake DBs in the open field. He has a good feel for breaking tackles in every way. Strong at the point of contact, willing to get north south for the extra yardage. Solid in pass pro, can get hands on and stun defenders.
cons: Had to transfer to the PAC-12 to become a star. Not fluid out of the backfield, doesn’t scare any defense. Doesn’t have the athleticism that you look for in a top back.
take: Charbonnet is the prototypical work horse back, he doesn’t need to come off the field because he does it all. He’s a big back that can play on 3rd down, make the right reads and break tackles. The only thing he’s missing is the next level athleticism.
RB Roschon Johnson Texas 76
info: 94 carries 545 yards and 5 TDs
pros: 4 star dual threat QB recruit, made the switch and was immediately a natural runner. Only one fumble in his career and never had a rush grade below 82. PFF had him as the most elusive back in NCAA. Not a fun guy to tackle, caused 46 missed tackles on 94 attempts. Powerful runner, at 6’2 220 he runs through defenders and has a lethal stiff arm. Has more shake in his game then expected, a few hurdles and noce jump cuts on his tape.
cons: Not much of a receiver, 5 drops and 56 reception in his career. Never ran for over 650 yards, he was never the starter. Not a top end athlete that will accelerate out of his cuts like the best do. Missing the top end speed to hit the home runs in space.
take: Johnson has been 2nd fiddle his entire career which is absurd because he may be the 2nd best RB in this class. If it wasn’t for a once in a decade talent like Robinson he would have been the talk of college football. The 6’2 220 pounder has all the makings of a star RB and should be coveted highly in the draft.
RB Tank Bigsby Auburn 75
info: Bigsby has never flown under the radar, as a high 4 star recruit, he had offers from everywhere including his first offer from Bama as a Sophomore. He went to school in LaGrange GA where he rushed for over 2,200 yards but didn't go to his hometown Georgia Bulldogs, he committed to Auburn where he immediately saw the field. He rushed for 834 yards and was named the SEC Freshman of the year. He came back as the full-time starter in 2021 where he got 224 carries and rushed for 1,100 yards and 10 TDs. His final year in 2022 was by far the most impressive he ran for 976 yards but a whopping 700 of them came after contact. He forced 60 missed tackles and averaged 4.16 yards after contact.
pros: Stepped up as a junior, forcing 60 missed tackles and had 740 yards after contact he was Auburns rushing attack. All around back that has good speed the ability to change directions well and enough power to fall forward. Has breakaway speed once he’s in the open field he can keep his distance from defenders. Solid contact balance, arm tackles look like they don’t affect him. Shown every year that he can run in the SEC at a high level.
cons: Fumbled 4 times in 2021, he cleaned it up in 2022 but still concerning. Not much receiving experience out of the backfield. Not the best back at setting up defenders to be blocked or taken out of the play. Not elite at any one thing, doesn’t have the elite speed/quickness or strength. Runs high which loses him a lot of power.
take: Bigsby is a very good running back with the track record to prove it. He has all the tools to be a good RB in the NFL he’s just lacking a selling point to get a team really excited. If he can develop his receiving/blocking into a strength he will be a great all around 3 down back.
RB Dewayne Mcbride UAB 75
info: Mcbride was a low 3 star recruit out of Starke FL and had very little interest so he went to UAB. He was a playmaker his true freshman year averaging 0.3 yards per carry on 47 attempts which lead him to be the starter in 2021. He ran for 1,366 and 13 TDs and had 78 forced missed tackles. 2022 blew that out of the water when he ran 1,702 yards 19 TDs and had a 94.1 PFF grade. He was named conference USA player of the year and solidified himself as one of the best backs in college football.
pros: Never had below a 90 PFF run grade in his 3 years. Had a career 7.2 YPC with 4.93 yards after contact and 175 forced missed tackles. Well built back with solid athleticism, he’s 5-11 215 and is a pretty good athlete that will meet all the thresholds. Amazing contact balance, spins out of sure tackles and keeps the feet moving at all times. Very strong, can squat 550 and bench 385.
cons: Fumbling could be an issue, 9 fumbles on 484 carries. Did all his work against a lower level of competition, probably wont be as successful at breaking tackles against higher level competition. Not a twitched up runner, wont shake anyone or accelerate that well.
take: Mcbride was incredible against UAB’s competition, he is a very strong back that can break tackles and do everything else pretty well. He’s not the best athlete at the position though, the speed acceleration and agility are all ok but isn’t something to get excited about. It is very easy to project Mcbride to be a starting RB at the next level given his ability to run between the tackles and make people miss.
RB Zach Evans Ole Miss 75
info: Evans was an absolute star coming out of North Shore in TX where he and Bijan were RBs 1 and 2 coming out of HS. He led his team to back to back 6A division 1 state championships while rushing for over 10 YPC. As a sophomore in HS the offers started to roll in, he got an offer from LSU and many other schools before ultimately deciding to go to TCU. He was a big play waiting to happen at TCU, he wasn't the starter but he was averaging over 7 YPC and forcing missed tackles left and right. He transferred to Ole Miss and became their starter along side Quinshon Judkins and had a solid season with 930 yards 6.5YPC and 9 TDs.
pros: Talented back that was always highly thought of, even when he was at TCU everyone knew he was an RB1 talent. Great speed and power combo, will run you over and then past pursuing defenders. Runs low to the ground, great leverage when driving forward in piles. Loves getting north and south, isn’t afraid to hit the crease and grind for extra yards. Very strong lower half, easily slips arm tackles as well and run through people.
cons: Too many times the ball is on the ground, he dropped 5 out of 30 balls and fumbles 3 times in 2021. Was not a good pass protector grading at a 29.6 PFF grade. Never was the lead back, always sharing the roll and never being the guy. Never did much outside of run it, not many receiving opportunities or pass pro.
take: Evans is a no nonsense RB, usually you think of bigger backs like that but at 6 foot 215 he packs a punch and will run through you. He’s an Zeke Elliot type runner but a big unknown of his game is the pass pro and receiving ability.
RB Tyjae Spears Tulane 75
info: 231 carries 1,586 yards 19 TDs.
pros: 63 forced missed tackles and 4.55 yards after contact. Consistently high PFF grades all 4 years. Solid out of the backfield in his career. Has great agility and athleticism, can take advantage of small windows and create big plays.
cons: Small for the position, 5’11 195 he’s a slim back. All his targets are checkdowns. Didn’t play the highest level competition, could struggle with better physicality at the next level.
take: Spears has shown he is a good back for the last 2 years and solidified his place in the NFL in 2022. He’s a very good athlete with the production to back it up that he should be drafted. He’s on the smaller side though which will limit his draft stock but he could end up making an impact in the NFL.
RB Israel Abanikanda Pitt 75
info: 241 carries 1,426 yards 20 TDs.
pros: Young prospect, only 20 years old. Had an amazing senior season, ran for 1,400 yards and 20 TDs with a 90.6 PFF grade. Great speed, ran away from so many defenders last year. Can break arm tackles and smaller defenders tackles with adequate strength.
cons: Was a non-factor in the pass game, never blocked well and only caught 12 balls. Doesn’t have the great quickness and agility that a speed back would want. Not a great tackle breaker, he’s more of a maximize what you blocked for back.
take: Abanikanda made himself some money this year with a break out 1,400 yard season. He is a back that will show how good your OL is, if the hole is there he will take advantage of it with his speed. But, if you ask him to create by himself that’s not his game and will turn losses into gains.
RB Kenny Mcintosh Georgia 74
info: 2022 stats: 151 carries 824 yards 10 TDs.
pros: 45 missed tackles forced on 151 carries. Very good out of the backfield, 92 and 86 PFF Rec grades in 2021 and 2022 with a career 75 receptions for 865 yards. Amazing hands, can track and pluck a ball out of the air down the field and also can run nice routes. Runs with good pad level even though he’s on the taller side. Pretty elusive, can run through contact and has a good feel for side stepping tackles.
cons: Never was the work horse back, always being the second guy or sharing the backfield. He doesn’t have the juice that you want in an RB, he isn’t great at accelerating or changing direction.
take: Mcintosh’s calling card is his receiving ability, he clearly has the talent to be a solid NFL RB but his work out of the backfield is what he’s special at. He’s lacking the short area quickness that you want to see in an RB but he does everything else at a high level.
RB Kendre Miller TCU 74
info: 224 carries 1,399 yards 17 TDs.
pros: Young prospect as a true junior, will be 20 when drafted. Ran for 1,400 yards and an 88.5 PFF grade in 2022. Solid size at 6’0 220. 70 missed tackles forced in 2022. He’s a jack of all trades, he can run past slower defenders and lower the shoulder to get extra yards. Good contact balance and has a good feel for making guys miss. Sets up blockers well with good patients and sees the blocks develop well before making his cut.
cons: Not much of a 3rd down back, low pass block grades and 16 receptions in 2022. One year of being the teams lead back and 6 fumbles in 361 attempts. Isn’t a top end athlete and doesn’t have overwhelming power. Can be a little indecisive at times, can get caught waiting for an opening rather than taking what he can get.
take: Miller was a key piece of TCU’s run to the national championship. He was a great runner for them with the size and ability to break big TD runs and get the extra yards when needed. He’s not the most explosive back but he’s already so good at such a young age he should be a contributing to an NFL team now and for many years.
RB Eric Gray Oklahoma 74
info: 212 carries 1,374 yards and 11 TDs.
pros: Rushing grade of 92.4 as a senior. Very elusive runner, good contact balance for size and bounces off DB’s. Can cut on a dime and completely throw off defenders angles. Has the speed and quickness to kill people in open space.
cons: Not a good pass blocker, struggled all 4 years. Didn’t run against many loaded boxes, Oklahoma’s offense was very spread out. Not a strong runner, won’t be running through many tackles. One year of being the starter and was 23 by the time he broke out.
take: Gray has some great highlights where he can make defenders look silly. He’s got great athleticism and moves very well in space. He’s not the most physically imposing back so he won’t be great all 3 downs but he can make plays in space that’s for sure.
RB Mohamed Ibrahim Minnesota 74
info: Ibrahim was a 3 star recruit coming out of Baltimore MD where he had a good career before committing to Minnesota. He redshirted in 2017 and in 2018 became the Minnesota Gophers 2nd leading rusher for a freshman behind Darrell Thompson. in 2019 for some reason he got less carries before having another 1000 yard season in 2020. He came back in 2021 ready to go absolutely gashing Ohio state for 160 and 2 TDs in 3 Quarters before going out for the season with an ankle injury. That led him to come back and only break Minnesota’s all time rushing record in his last bowl game against Syracuse.
pros: Production is great, 3 1,000 yard seasons and was consistent around 5.4 YPC. Over 2,200 yards after contact with 70 forced missed tackles. He’s a Damion Pierce light, absolute menace with the ball and not very fun to tackle. Strong back, easily runs secondary defenders over and pushes piles in short yards. Great contact balance, not an easy guy to bring down. Pretty good vision, will make you be gap discipline.
cons: Almost never was used in the pass game, 21 career receptions in 5 years. Older RB prospect, 5th year coming out. He is very slow changing direction and doesn’t have good speed.
take: Ibrahim is a great 2 down runner and would have been perfect in 1990. The game favors faster more explosive players now but that doesn’t mean theres no role for a throw back strong physical RB like him. He can be a great thunder to another backs lighting.
RB Chase Brown Illinois 74
info: 329 carries 1,632 yards 10 TDs
pros: Lead the nation in yards and was the bell cow for Illinois. Has very good speed for the position, hit 22.5 MPH in a game. Pretty good vision, lets block develop and can bust through the line.
cons: 5th year player who only broke out his last year. Didn’t lead the league in rushing without an absurd number of carries. He’s on the slimmer side for the position, doesn’t run through contact well.
take: Brown was Illinois offense last year after 4 longer years of waiting to break out. He’s got the great speed to make in impact in the NFL but the strength is a real concern. He should be able to contribute to a backfield immediately.
RB Sean Tucker Syracuse 74
info: Tucker was one of the top RBs coming out of Owings Mills MD where he was also a track star winning the 100 and 200 m as a junior. He got looks from a few schools like Wisconsin and Syracuse and chose to stay closer to home and commit the Orange. His opportunity came early while many opt outs and injuries caused him to be bumped up the depth chart. He ran for 626 yards that true freshman year and put his name in the spotlight of potential NFL RBs. He solidified that thought by playing great in 2021, he ran for 1,515 with 6.1 YPC and 12 TDs while breaking 66 missed tackles and 4.11 YPC after contact. He was an All American after that year and was on the Doak Walker award radar heading in to 2022. It was a little disappointing of a 2022 season but he still played well, accounting for much of Syracuse’s total yards he ran for 1062 yards with 11 TDs but only averaged 2.79 Yards after contact.
pros: Well-built RB with good speed, 5'10 210 and has plenty of breakaway runs, once he gets into space he’s gone. Produced on a Syracuse team that didn't have much talent, the OL was awful. Has good power to run up the middle and grind for yards. Flashes some good body control on receptions out of the backfield. Good in the open field, a nice side step to go along with his great speed.
cons: Not the best out of the backfield, 13.7 drop percentage for his career. Doesn’t have the short area quickness to make a guy miss in a phone booth and accelerate through a hole. Likes to bounce to the outside a lot, granted his OL did no favors.
take: Tucker was the best skill player from Syracuse in years, his OL did him no favors but he flashed his extreme talent anyway. He’s a solid size to go along with great long speed which teams are going to like. He will never be a top guy in the NFL (he’s not breaking tackles left and right) but he can definitely be a good RB for many years.
RB Devon Achane Texas A&M 73
info: Achane was a top 4 star RB coming out of Missouri City TX and somehow chose Texas A&M over the power house of Syracuse. He immediatley got playing time in 2020 where he got 43 carries for 364 yards and a 91 PFF grade. By his junior year he became there top RB and ran the ball 196 times for 1,100 yards and 8 TDs with an 89.8 run grade.
pros: 3 straight 89.8+ PFF rush grades with a total of 2,349 yards at 6.4 YPC. Forced 51 missed tackes with 705 of his 1,100 yards after contact. Could be an explosive change of pace back, he was amazing when he was used sparingly rather then the work horse. Produced with terrible blocking in front of him, not may opportunities for him to get free yards. Great cuts, can stop and start on a dime. Stronger contact balance that you would assume for a 180 pound back. Uses a stiff arm pretty well, can surprise defenders with a quick stiff arm. He has angle breaking speed, can get to the edge of the defense with ease. Good vision on zone concepts, rarely hits the wrong hole and makes the most of what he has.
cons: A terrible pass protector, 27.2 pass block grade with a 10% pressure rate. Small back at 180 who struggles to run up the middle, 3.7 YPC there. Not as effective when he has to carry the bulk of the work in the backfield, efficiency numbers significantly dropped in his lone year as the guy. Don’t love him in a man scheme, a little to bounce happy there.
take: Teams always are looking for a “home run hitter” at RB and that’s exactly what Achane is. He’s such a good athlete he makes defenders look silly, his jump cuts and speed leave defenders in the dust and is dangerous every time he has the ball. He has the ability to be a work horse but he’s most effective as a change of pace back that will take advantage of a tired defense.
RB Lew Nichols Central Michigan 72
info: 175 attempts 6 TD 69.5 RUN.
pros: Great 2021 season, 1,846 yards 16 TDs and a PFF grade of 84.8. Solid size at 5’11 222. Has excellent short area burst, can deliver a blow in 1 step. Good quickness and vision to find the hole.
cons: Massive drop off in 2022. Not very good out of the backfield. Lost a little speed in 2022 by gaining some weight.
take: Nichols was the Central Michigan offense in 2021, he put up impressive numbers. In 2022 he added some weight but kept his good feet a vision and added power. He’s a great RB build with good explosiveness but he doesn’t have the speed and pass catching ability that a number 1 back would want now a days. He should be a good RB2 in the league.
RB Deuce Vaughn Kansas St 72
info: Vaughn was born in Fayetteville AR and moved to play HS football in Round Rock TX. He accumulated 5,472 all purpose yards to go along with 50 TDs in his career there. He had offers from many SEC schools but chose K State over them where he played as a true freshman and was named the Big 12 freshman of the year after getting 1,221 all purpose yards. His next season in 2021 was great, he had over a 91 PFF grade while rushing for over 1,500 yards and was All big 12 1st team. In 2022 he had a similar statistical year to make his mark as one of the best backs Kansas State has ever had.
pros: He's been a work horse for Kansas State, 3000 yards and over 500 carries in the last 2 years. Forced 106 missed tackles in the last 2 years with 27 TDs. Doesn't fumble often, only 2 career fumbles on 646 carries. Very good out of the backfield with a career 117 receptions and 1,275 yards. Great change of direction and quickness to his game, makes people completely whiff at times. Has break away speed and wont be caught by any LBs. Not afraid of contact, wont dance away from it.
cons: He's beyond small, you wont find a smaller back in the league at 5'6 175. Under an average of 3 yards after contact. Awful pass blocker, 21.3 is his highest PFF grade. Not going to get extra yards through contact. Probably wont be able to pass block.
take: Everything about Vaughn has to have the disclaimer of he’s so small. It’s hard to succeed in the NFL at his size but he can find a nice role out of the backfield in spread situations especially.
RB Chris Rodriguez Kentucky 72
info: 175 carries 904 yards 6 TDs.
pros: 2 grades over 90 for rushing. A career 6.2 YPC with 3,642 yards. Big well built back at 5’11 224. Packs a punch on initial contact, can easily run over defenders. Runs angry, arm tackles wont stop him and he’s not a fun back to bring down.
cons: Suspended for an unknown reason to start the 2022 season. Older prospect, this is his 5th year in college. Never a plus receiver, essentially a running back only. Can want to get too north and south sometimes, running straight into lineman. Not much quickness to his game, won’t make people whiff in space.
take: Rodriguez is an old school runner that would be a great back in the 80’s. He’s powerful has solid speed and put up numbers through out his career. He’s got the off field red flags and isn’t much of a pass catcher but that shouldn’t prevent him from finding a home in the NFL.
RB Tiyon Evans Louisville 71
info: 83 carries 518 yards 6 TDs 76.7 RUN.
pros: 22 missed tackles forced on 83 attempts. Good strong muscular build. Explosive athlete, can burst through the line well and keep his feet going. Solid speed, has the break away speed in the 2nd level.
cons: fumbled 3 times in 83 attempts. Why did he only get 164 college carries, he’s better than that. Injured in 2022 and missed his chance to show out.
take: If you were to watch Evans in a game he starts you wouldn’t believe that he never broke 100 carries. He’s the perfect build with a muscular frame and strong legs. He also is an explosive athlete with some speed and contact balance. I wouldn’t be surprised if he cleans up his fumbles if he becomes an impactful RB.
RB Evan Hull Northwestern 71
info: 220 carries 914 yards 5 TDs.
pros: Student of the game, he has good vision with a solid feel for setting up defenders. Can produce out of the backfield, over 500 yards receiving. Good at running feet through contact, he will churn for extra yards.
cons: Poor pass blocking grades, 92% pass block rate. Not going to make people miss cleanly, will break a tackle but isn’t dangerous after that. Athleticism is lacking, the quickness and speed are barely NFL level.
take: Hull will not be impressing anyone with a highlight tape but he does a lot of things good enough to play in the NFL. He’s a back up through and through but he could be a nice 3rd back on a team.
RB SaRodorick Thompson Texas Tech 70
info: 138 attempts 682 yards 7 TDs 82.5 RUN.
pros: 5 years of solid production. Solid size and burst, 5’11 213 and has some shake to his game. He wants to get every yard he can, feet always moving to either make a defender miss or drive forward. Broke 42 tackles in 138 attempts in 2022.
cons: Never was the guys, highest yardage in a season is 763. Bone bruise at the end of 2022 in his ankle. Isn’t the fastest or the strongest back, will be a middling NFL athlete.
take: Thompson is a solid back that tics all the boxes, he’s big enough and athletic enough to play in the league. He runs hard and forces a lot of missed tackles and was top 20 in elusiveness rating. He was never the guy in college but he can certainly be a great 2 for a team.
RB Jordan Mims Fresno St 70
info: 260 carries 1,371 yards 18 TD 90.2 RUN.
pros: Hasn’t fumbled in 5 years, 500 straight carries with no fumbles. Good vision and patience, he finds the hole and sets blockers up well. Solid quickness, can cut well and make short area moves to find space.
cons: A tad undersized at 5’10 200. Old prospect, played his freshman year in 2017. Not much of a receiver, only 132 yards in 2022. Not the best tackle breaker, his size isn’t ideal for that. Not a top tier athlete, isn’t going to be showing off his speed and burst in the NFL.
take: Mims made some money by coming back to school, he racked up over 1000 yards and 18 TDs. He showed his ability to take advantage of his blocks and set them up to get every yard possible. Quickness is the physical attribute he will rely on and not strength or speed which isn’t ideal for a lead back. He is certainly good enough for the NFL and should make a roster.
RB Christopher Brooks BYU 70
info: 129 attempts 820 yards 6 TD 82.1 RUN.
pros: Never fumbled in his career. 6’1 235, he’s a hoss. Higher Elusiveness rating than Jahmyr Gibbs. Runs behind his pads, will fight for every yard.
cons: Never cracked 1000 yards and wasn’t the lead dog. Not many receiving opportunities. Not impressive cutting, high center of gravity.
take: Brooks is a tank of a power back, at 6 foot 235 he can push a pile at the goal line. He’s not going to do anything else but be a power back but he’s good at it.
RB Keaton Mitchell East Carolina 70
info: 201 carries 1,452 yards 14 TDs.
pros: Back to back 1,000 yard seasons with a PFF rush grade if 93.9. Forced 75 missed tackles in 2022 while rushing for 7.2 YPA. Good change of direction, low center of gravity makes cutting easy for him. Explosive athlete, can accelerate and run past defenders.
cons: Not a very good pass protector, he’s only 5’9 183. Level of competition is a concern. No strength to his game, never going to be a physically dominate RB.
take: Mitchell is an electric back with solid contact balance and good athleticism. His biggest knocks are his size and competition level which are real concerns. He should be able to be a returner or maybe even find himself as a change of pace back in the league.
RB Khalan Laborn Marshall 69
info: 303 carries 1,535 yards 15 TD 84.4 RUN.
pros: Former 5 star with good size, 5’10 210. Good athlete, cuts hard and accelerates well. Runs very hard, trys to get every yard.
cons: Was dismissed from Florida State. Didn’t play for 2 years and only had one productive year. Bad vision, not patient and doesn’t see the blocks well. Not very balanced, doesn’t run through tackles well and can slip too much on cuts.
take: Laborn is a great athlete that runs hard every play. He showed against good competition he can’t run through tackles like you would like and his balance is mediocre. The former 5 star could make a roster though with his physical ability.
RB Jarveon Howard Alcorn St 69
info: 250 carries 1,239 yards 12 TD 77.1 RUN.
pros: 68 MTF in 2022. Got better every year and dominated the first year he got a shot. Runs hard with very good contact balance. Good burst, he explodes into contact and through the line.
cons: Couldn’t get on the field at Syracuse. Not a top tier athlete, he doesn’t have the great agility or top speed. Questionable vision, doesn’t look to set up blockers and give them time to set up.
take: Howard was a top back in the SWAC this year, getting 1,239 yards and 68 MTF. He’s a tackle breaker that runs angry and with good contact balance. He’s not the level of athlete to be drafted high or the vision to be an RB one, but he has a shot of making the roster as the 3rd back.
RB Ronnie Brown Shepherd 69
info: 219 carries 1863 yards 19 TDs. 5’10 192 with 30 1/8 arms and 8 ½ hands.
pros: Student of the game. Was a very productive work horse. Tested well running a 4.46 with a 4.00 shuttle and a 6.89 3 cone jumping 37 inches. Good speed and can cut and change directions well.
cons: Smaller back at 192. Played at a D2 school, massive talent drop off.
take: NA
RB Percy Agyei-Obese James Madison 68
info: 159 attempts 905 yards 8 TD 80.0 RUN.
pros: Sick name. Never graded above 80 overall in 6 years. 6 foot 213, he’s a good size. Can do a little of everything, drop the shoulder, stiff arm, jump cut and run a little bit.
cons: 10 fumbles on 600 carries. Is already 24. Not an explosive athlete, cuts and acceleration are alright.
take: Agyei-Obese is an all around solid back. He’s a good size with decent athleticism and goo vision. He has no trump card to make him stick out in the NFL but he can run in the NFL.
RB Tavion Thomas Utah 68
info: 142 carries 676 yards 7 TDs.
pros: Back to back years of 85+ PFF rush grades and 28 TDs. Great size at 6’2 240, has the power back build. Always falling forward for extra yardage.
cons: 10 fumbles on 476 attempts. Took a step back in 2022, graded lower and rushed for 500 less yards. Not a good receiver out of the backfield, a career 50 receiving yards. Has no juice to his game, the speed and quickness are lacking.
take: Thomas is your prototypical big back that can play on short yardage plays. He’s not going to be a lead guy anywhere but can fill the power back role if needed.
RB Travis Dye USC 68
info: 146 attempts 889 yards 9 TD 82.6 RUN.
pros: A lot of experience, ran for nearly 4,000 yards in his career and had 734 as a true freshman. Was a leader of a resurgent USC team. Plays with no gloves, he’s a baller. Solid out of the backfield, willing to block and solid hands. Has pretty good acceleration and change of direction.
cons: 29 inch arms and 205 pounds, he’s small overall. 10 college fumbles in 666 attempts. Fractured his ankle in 2022. Not big fast or strong, that’s a bad combination. Doesn’t break many tackles.
take: Dye is a high character productive RB that played at top tier programs for the last 5 years. He is just not what an NFL RB looks like, he’s small and doesn’t have the blazing speed. He may find himself on the back of a roster but it will be tough.
RB Hunter Luepke North Dakota St 68
info: 97 attempts 628 yards 9 TD 81.8 RUN.
pros: had a 92 PFF grade in 2021, he was a do it all player. Big strong player that can do it all, lead block, run and catch. Has good feet for a FB, solid cuts and decent athlete.
cons: 2022 shoulder injury shortened his season. He’s a full back. He hasn’t blocked that much and has played a lower level of competition.
take: Luepke is a full back, most teams don’t have one and they are easy to find. He was a great runner in college and has receiving experience but again he’s a full back.
RB Xazavian Valladay Arizona St 68
info: 215 yards 1,192 yards 16 TD 86.4 RUN.
pros: 5 years of production and 4,465 career yards. Graded over 78 for last 4 years. Good zone runner, can press the line and cut well. Runs hard, will try to fall forward and get every yard.
cons: Never really dominated all 5 years, just solid production. 5’11 199, he’s on the smaller side. Not a string runner, arm tackles can get him and he wont run through contact well.
take: Valladay is an outside zone runner only, he isn’t meant for any other scheme. He has good vision and has the speed and cutting ability to be a good back in that system but that’s it. He’s small and not strong enough to run through contact so it will be difficult for him to stick on a roster.
RB Deshaun Fenwick Oregon St 68
info: 113 attempts 553 yards 7 TD 78.4 RUN.
pros: Good size at 6 foot 226. Consistent 70’s PFF grade. Runs very hard, fights for yards and wants to hit. Good at cutting and accelerating for a bigger back.
cons: Never broke 560 yards rushing in 5 years. Not a great athlete, wont be a burner. Can get too aggressive running instead of seeing blocks develop.
take: Fenwick is a solid back that runs at 100%. He can cut and run behind his pads well but he’s not a great athlete and he never produced much. He should battle for a 3rd RB spot.
RB Tucker Gregg Georgia St 68
info: 171 attempts 709 yards 12 TD 74.3 RUN.
pros: Solid build at 5’10 220. Good downhill runner, runs behind his pads and falls forward.
cons: Doesn’t make many guys miss, more of a straight forward runner.
take: Gregg doesn’t know how to not run someone over. He’s a one trick pony that is a no non sense runner that will pick up 1 more yard than you block for.
RB Isaiah Bowser UCF 68
info: 206 attempts 795 yards 16 TD 73.9 RUN.
pros: 6’1 225, good RB size. Strong runner, he runs behind his pads well. Solid vision, see’s what the offense is blocking. Decent at making the first guy miss at the line.
cons: Not a receiving threat, he had 14 receptions in 2022. Not a quick back, cuts and acceleration are lacking. Production was just ok, averaged a career 4.0 yards per carry. Pass pro is meh.
take: Bowser is a big back that runs with solid power. He is a short yardage guy that can serve a role for a team. He’s lacking the athleticism to be drafted but he can play in the NFL.
RB Nathaniel Peat Missouri 68
info: 101 attempts 443 yards 2 TD 72.3 RUN.
pros: Former Stanford player, probably smart. Runs hard and fights for yards. Good balance, runs through arm tackles. Decent cuts, low center of gravity.
cons: never ran over 450 yards in a season. Not fast, his acceleration and speed are mediocre. Not the best vision, can be too patient.
take: Peat is a former Stanford RB that runs very hard. He’s not a good athlete though so he will never be a starter but he could possibly be a nice 3rd RB.
RB Nasir Smith Central Connecticut St 68
info: 228 attempts 1,203 yards 13 TD 88.1 RUN.
pros: Good size at 5’10 220. Used to play for Auburn HS where he carried the worst team ever. Good burst and strength, will run through contact.
cons: Played against no names. Not the top end athlete, wont be sprinting away from anyone.
take: Smith has come a long way from Auburn HS in NY. He was the only good player on the team because of his good burst and hard running style. He’s not the best athlete though and didn’t play good competition so it will be interesting to see if he gets a shot.
RB Tyler Hoosman North Dakota 68
info: 175 attempts 1,020 yards 12 TD 89.2 RUN.
pros: Good vision and good patience. Good contact balance, doesn’t go down easy and has a good feel for avoiding defenders.
cons: Couldn’t be the starter at Norther Iowa. Played in the FCS against easy competition. Not a high end athlete, wont blow anyone away with speed.
take: Hoosman is a solid back but only had one good year. He see the field well and can avoid contact without being a top end athlete. He should get a shot at making a roster.
RB Jaleel McLaughlin Youngstown 68
info: 228 attempts 1,584 yards 13 TD 90.6 RUN.
pros: Back to back 1000+ years with 12+ TDs and nearly 7 YPC. 1 Fumble in 537 attempts. FCS All American that was ultra productive. Good vision and cutting ability, can get through a hole very well. Good athlete, speed and agility are there.
cons: Graded very poorly in pass blocking. 5’9 183 pounds, he’s extremely small.
take: McLaughlin was a very productive back at Youngstown over the last 2 years. He has very good athleticism and vision but he is just very small. He probably wont make a roster with that size but he’s worth a look.
RB Marcus Cooper Incarnate Word 68
info: 211 attempts 1,440 yards 11 TD 91.1 RUN.
pros: 91.1 RUN grade with nearly 7 YPC. Good speed and runs hard. Good vision and acceleration.
cons: 5’8 185, he’s a small back. No power, will get man handled. Dances too much in the backfield.
take: Cooper is another very small athletic productive FCS back. He should absolutely get a shot at the NFL but his size will limit him.
RB Brad Roberts Air Force 68
info: 344 attempts 1,723 yards 17 TD 87 RUN. 5’11 215.
pros: Back to back 1000+ yard seasons and only 2 career fumbles. Good vision and adequate speed to get to the second level.
cons: Not a fluid athlete, isn’t a tackle breaker. Played in a different offense at the full back position.
take: NA
RB Camerun Peoples Appalachian St 67
info: 100 carries 592 yards 5 TDs.
pros: 6’2 225, good size. Good combination of size and speed for special teams.
cons: 5th year RB with only 592 yards his 5th year. Runs way too upright. No quicks to his game, not an explosive athlete.
take: Peoples had a solid RB career at Appalachian State where he ran for 2,800 yards. He’s not a good enough runner to be a guy in the NFL but his size and speed give a little hope to him making an NFL roster.
RB Deneric Prince Tulsa 67
info: 127 attempts 734 yards 5 TD 72.8 RUN.
pros: Solid size at 6 foot 217. Used in the pass game a good amount. Somehow makes people miss.
cons: Never had a breakout year at Tulsa, the most yards he has ever had was 734. Is not explosive, cuts and acceleration are meh. Tall and runs high.
take: Prince was solid for tulsa, he had a few good games but nothing to write home about. He’s a solid RB that can play in the NFL but he can’t be an NFL starter.
RB Emari Demercado TCU 67
info: 121 attempts 681 yards 6 TD 77.5 RUN.
pros: 1 fumble in over 300 career attempts. 5’11 210, he’s a good build. Solid athlete, can get skinny and accelerate through the line.
cons: Was never the starter, and never ran for over 700 yards. Only really played for his last 2 years. Not much of a receiver, only 13 reception in 2022. Can’t run through contact, he’s got no power.
take: Demercado took a while to see the field, he’s not the strongest runner. He’s got some ability to accelerate through the line but he’s not going to be a reliable NFL back.
RB Hassan Hall Georgia Tech 67
info: 116 attempts 522 yards 1 TD 76.9 RUN.
pros: caught 28 balls in 2022, showed he can catch. Has pretty good speed and will run his feet.
cons: 6 foot sub 200, he’s a skinny back. Not a strong runner and his balance is questionable.
take: Hall is a solid speed back that has some nice runs in his tape but not enough of them.  He’s a slim build that will struggle with NFL physicality.
RB Jamyest Williams Georgia St 67
info: 85 attempts 459 yards 2 TD 76.4 RUN
pros: Quick and Fast. Sets up blocks well, good patience.
cons: 5’9 185, he’s very small. Played nobodies. No power to his game, gets taken down easy.
take: Williams was the lightning to Tucker Greggs thunder. They formed a good RB duo at Georgia State but his size will limit if he can play in the NFL.
RB Ellis Merriweather Massachusetts 67
info: 152 carries 611 yards 3 TD 67.9 RUN.
pros: Great size at 6’1 225. 2-time team captain. Solid 2021 campaign, 1,130 yards. Big back that will fall forward.
cons: Dropped off from 2021, way less efficient. Not much of a receiver, 7 receptions in 2022. Got killed against all the power 5 opponents. Not a tackle breaker, 20 TF on 152 attempts. Runs high and loses leverage.
take: Merriweather is a good sized back that was a staple of UMASS’s offense. He fights for extra yards and has solid power but that’s all his game is. Quickness, tackle breaking and speed aren’t there so it will be tough for him to play in the NFL. He has a shot to make a roster especially with his size but it’s a long shot.
RB Jacob Saylors East Tennessee 67
info: 227 carries 1,318 yards 15 TD 79.5 RUN.
pros: Tackle breaking machine, 67 MTF. Solid short area quickness, nice spin and quick cut. Killed Wofford.
cons: Not a good athlete. Smaller back that played at a lower competition level.
take: I want to see Saylors on an NFL field to see if he can replicate his college runs. He’s a tackle break at the FCS level but he’s an average athlete that’s undersized which is not a good thing for the NFL.
RB Marques DeShields Rhode Island 67
info: 184 attempts 1,173 yards 12 TD 79.9 RUN.
pros: 5 out of last 6 games over 100 yards. Solid speed, can break a long TD. Low center of gravity, can cut well.
cons: Didn’t even open the season as the starter. Dances a lot in the backfield to get nowhere. Not the biggest, 5’9 200.
take: DeShields played pretty well against his only FBS opponent and took over the offense at Rhode Island. He is an undersized back with some speed and agility and the production to go with it. The NFL will be a massive adjustment but he should get a training camp chance.
RB Ulonzo Gilliam UC Davis 67
info: 200 attempts 1,192 yards 13 TD 81 RUN.
pros: 5 years of production with 3 900+ seasons. Hasn’t fumbled in 2 years. 2 time team captain and All Big sky 1st team. 90 receptions over the last 2 years. Runs with good patience and is a solid athlete, see’s the play develop and has the quickness to hit the hole.
cons: 5’9 189 pounds, he’s a small back. Not strong and good at breaking tackles, he wont be creating on his own.
take: Gilliam is a good FCS back that produce for 5 years. He’s small but has good vision and athleticism but he’s just small. It will be a tough ask for him to make a team.
RB Carlos Washington Southeastern Louisiana 67
info: 148 attempts 725 yards 82.9 RUN.
pros: Good size, 5’11 220. He runs hard and with good power.
cons: Never ran over 800 yards. Not agile, his lateral agility and burst are only ok.
take: Washington didn’t have the most impressive college career playing at a low end school and not being a 1000 yard runner. He’s not the most athletic but he has a great build and runs hard. He has a chance to make it in the league.
RB Deonta McMahon McNeese 67
info: 190 attempts 1,415 yards 12 TD 90.4 RUN.
pros: 7.4 YPC, that’s an insane YPC. Good quickness and vision, can run between the tackles at his size.
cons: 5’9 185, he’s a small back. Not much strength. Not the blazing fast speed a 185 pounder needs.
take: McMahon was a dynamic RB for McNeese but he’s just small. You can see his quickness and agility are very good but the speed needs to be a different level at that size.
RB Trey Sneed Fordham 67
info: 198 attempts 1,140 yards 5 TD 91.5 RUN.
pros: 91.5 RUN grade with 58 MTF. Solid size, 5’11 215. Good ability to break tackles, solid contact balance.
cons: Has been playing since 2016 and didn’t play well until he was 25. Doesn’t have great power or athleticism.
take: Sneed has a great season 91.5 RUN grade and over 1,140 yards. He’s a solid back that does most things you would like an RB to do but he’s not special. He was a freshman in 2016 and just had his breakout season.
RB Jarek Broussard Michigan St 67
info: 63 attempts 298 yards 3 TD 81.3 RUN.
pros: Good vision, sets up blocks well and finds open lanes. Good acceleration on his cuts.
cons: Small back, 5’9 185 he isn’t going to run through contact. Not much receiving experience where he would have to thrive. Overall production isn’t there.
take: NA
RB Trelon Smith UTSA 67
info: 54 attempts 190 yards 2 TD 70.6 RUN.
pros: Good patience. Very good agility, cuts are violent.
cons: Small back at 5’9 185. Ends up on the ground too easy, whether that be just getting tripped up or slipping.
take: NA
RB Kairee Robinson San Jose St 67
info: 156 attempts 756 yards 10 TD 90.6 RUN. 5’8 200.
pros: Good build, low center of gravity and a solid frame.
cons: Only 2 career fumbles. Not much of a receiving threat. Not a violent runner that can break tackles. Speed isn’t there.
take: NA
RB Brenden Brady UTSA 67
info: 154 attempts 698 yards 9 TD.
pros: 2 career fumbles. Compact runner, can run through arm tackles.
cons: One year starter without a 700+ yard season. Not a quick player, wont accelerate on his cuts.
take: NA

take: NA
RB Dedrick Parson Hawaii 66
info: 187 attempts 830 yards 11 TD 83.2 RUSH.
pros: Solid grading at 88  and 83 in the last 2 years. Good build at 5’8 205. Good quick burst and cuts.
cons: Under 5 yards a carry and 3 fumbles in 2022. Power isn’t there, in the run game he can get tossed around and isn’t great in the pass game.
take: Parsons is a compact RB with solid quickness and burst. He’s small though and wont hold up great on an NFL field do to lack of speed and power. He will be a long shot to make it.
RB Ronald Awatt UTEP 66
info: 163 attempts 734 yards 2 TD 69.8 RUN
pros: Decent athlete, can run well for 6 foot 205. Has some agility to him, can cut and hit a hole.
cons: 6 receptions in 2022, not a receiving back. Not much of a tackle breaker, 26 MTF in 163 attempts.
take: Awatt was a solid 2 year starter for UTEP but physically he’s not very strong and can’t run through tackles well. He may make a training camp roster but it will be tough to make a 53.
RB Narii Gaither Gardener-Webb 66
info: 153 attempts 976 yards 7 TD 77.4 RUN.
pros: Back to back over 900 yard seasons. Good athlete, has some speed to his game as well as agility.
cons: Got injured on one run at costal Carolina. Listed at 180 which is small.
take: Gaither is a smaller speed and agility back that played well for 2 years for Gardener Webb. He’s small though and hasn’t seen real competition so it’s an uphill climb for his NFL chances.
RB Jacob Chisholm Dayton 66
info: 232 attempts 1,040 yards 13 TD 82 RUN.
pros: 3 straight 1000 yard seasons and hasn’t fumbled in the last 2 years. Consistent runner, same yards and MTF back to back years. Team captain 2 straight years. Solid receiving option, 600 yards and 9 TDs over last 2 years and had a 91.4 grade. Solid vision and quickness to hit the open hole.
cons: FCS RB, played against non-competitive competition. 5’9 191 pounds, small back. Not strong, will not run over anyone or be good through contact.
take: Chisholm is a small productive back that was good in the FCS. He’s has some solid quickness and vision but he’s just very small.
RB Julien Gums Nicholls 66
info: 196 attempts 873 yards 4 TD 83.8 RUN.
pros: Nichols all time leading rusher. Great size at 5’10 230.
cons: Not a receiving threat with only 10 catches in 2022. Never ran for over 900 yards and had a sub 5 YPC in 2022. Not a good athlete, not quick or fast.
take: Gums was a solid back for Nicholls and is a strong runner. He isn’t athletic though and probably can’t make the NFL.
RB Todd Sibley Albany 66
info: 152 attempts 986 yards 10 TD 85.2 RUN.
pros: Former Pitt RB, has FBS experience. Ran 6.5 YPC in 2022 and an 85 RUN grade. 5’9 220, solid RB build.
cons: Couldn’t make in in the FBS. 12 career receptions, not good. Not an athlete, can’t win a foot race or make quick moves.
take: Sibley is a well built RB that played pretty well in the FCS. He just isn’t a good athlete and could handle the FBS so the NFL is a stretch.
RB Alex Fontenot Colorado 66
info: 66 attempts 311 yards 2 TD 79.8 RUN. 6’0 200.
pros: Had a breakout sophomore year with 873 yards.
cons: Only ran for 311 yards his senior year. Cuts are slow, doesn’t have the juice to run zone. Not an aggressive runner, wont run through anyone.

cons: Played at Nevada. 4.7 YPC in his career. Not an athlete, speed acceleration and power aren’t there.
take: Taua is a solid back that gets what you block for him. He’s not big strong or fast so I don’t think he will make a roster.
RB Jalen Holston Virginia Tech 65
info: 90 attempts 321 yards 5 TDs 67.9 RUN.
pros: He went to Virginia Tech. Solid size at 5’11 210.
cons: 6th year senior that has a career total od 1,200 yards. Sub 4 YPC.
take: Holston barely played, he’s a solid size and is an ok back. He’s not quick at all though and may not get a shot at the NFL.
RB Shaun Shivers Indiana 65
info: 144 attempts 587 yards 6 TD 72.2 RUN.
pros: Former SEC back behind Tank Bigsby. Spark plug of a runner, runs angry.
cons: 5’7 180, too small. Waited 5 years to become a starter and maxed out at 587 yards.
take: Shivers is a very small back that probably wont make it in the NFL. He runs hard as hell though and has had some success against power 5 teams.
RB Dom Williams Norther Iowa 65
info: 129 attempts 711 yards 9 TD 78.7 RUN.
pros: Team captain as a senior. 5’10 200 decent build.

pros: Over 1000 yards in 2022. 5’10 220, he’s a solid build.
cons: Only one year of production and was in college in 2017.

info: 176 attempts 1,044 yards 8 TD 85.7 RUN.
pros: Good size, 6 foot 220 pounds. Improved every year ending in a 1k season.
cons: 2 career receptions, no experience. Played at Holy Cross, the competition was bad. Not an athlete.

info: 87 attempts 364 yards 3 TD 67.3 RUN.
pros: 4 straight years of solid grading. Quick and fast.
cons: 5’9 180 pounds, he’s too small to play. Fumbled 4 times in 2022. Missed time in 2022 with an injury.

info: 204 attempts 935 yards 6 TD 67.6 RUN.
pros: Solid change of direction, cuts are crisp.
cons: Played in the FCS but wasn’t top of the line.

pros: NA
cons: NA
take: NA

pros: Stater over former Ohio State RB at Arkansas St. Quick and fast.
