OT Peter Skoronski Northwestern 88
info: Skoronski was a solid 4 star recruit coming out of Park Ridge IL and was heavily recruited by Notre Dame but committed to Northwestern as an interior OL. He followed in his grandfather’s footsteps though, he played OT for the Packers and is in the Green Bay Packers hall of fame so he started as a true freshman at LT. He immediately played well earning a true Freshman All-American spot and a 2nd team all big 10. His sophomore year he continued his domination and was named to the first team all big 10 while grading at 83.8 and only allowing 97.4% allowed pressure rate. In 2022 his final year he came back with one goal in mind, dominate. That’s exactly what he did, he gave up on 6 total pressures all year with a 99.2% allowed pressure rate which is the best in the nation. He was named 2nd team All American and was the best pass protector in college football.
pros: One of the best college pass protectors, only gave up 6 total pressures on 474 pass blocking snaps. Amazing in pass pro, everything about it is nearly perfect. Feet are great, always balanced and always keeps his feet moving in the run game. Great hands, the placement is nearly perfect every time and his hands in pass pro are awesome. Good at picking up stunts and blitzes, keeps his eyes up and understands defensive stunts.
cons: Not the longest limbed tackle, gets pushed away by longer edge players. Doesn't have that next level athleticism, pop in run game is average and not a great mover in space.
take: Skoronski is one of the best pass protectors to come out of college recently, he does it with great technique and solid athleticism and strength. He's reminds me a lot of his former teammate Rashawn Slater, a great OL that lacks the power and length to be a top 5 pick. He's a great offensive lineman though who could immediately step in and start for any team in the NFL.
OT Anton Harrison Oklahoma 83
info: 1,866 career snaps 72.6 RBLK 83.3 PBLK 9 pressure.
pros: True junior that played every year and started the last 2. Always graded well in pass pro in a pass heavy offense. Solid size and strength, 6’5 310. Very Smooth mover, looks very balanced as solid in pass pro. Great at mirroring DE’s always keeps a good relationship between him  the defender and the QB. Holds his own in the run game, gives great effort.
cons: Would like to see him gain some strength to really start moving people in the run game and anchor better. Played in a unique spread offense where the box was never loaded. Needs to clean up hand placement, still needs to develop that aspect.
take: Harrison is a young good pass protector that impressed all year. He has the issues that young tackles have, he needs more strength and to continue to work on technique but he has shown plenty of good play throughout his career.
OT Dawand Jones Ohio St 83
info: 1,723 career snaps 85 RBLK grade 79.5 PBLK grade 5 pressures.
pros: 2 year starter where he graded above 82 both times. Massive tackle at 6’8 360, dwarfs many defenders he sees. The best physical measurements I've ever seen. 0 sacks and 5 pressure his senior year. Solid run blocking grades, 90 and 85. Great punch timing and placements. Has long arms to keep pass rushers away from him. Can move people in the run game with power.
cons: Slow feet that makes it harder for him to mirror speed rushers. Can get off balance because of his limited athleticism.
take: Jones is ready to step into tackle and play day 1, he’s got the frame that makes OL coaches happy. He’s super long and has solid strength, if he could just get quicker feet he would be an All Pro player at some point in his career.
OT Paris Johnson Ohio St 82
info: Johnson was the top OT in the class of 2020 along side Georgias Broderick Washington. Johnson stayed local going from his HS in Cincinnati to Ohio State where he served as a backup his entire freshman season. His Sophomore season he got the starting job and was very impressive as Ohio States RG grading out at a 79 PFF grade. He became the LT for the Buckeyes in his final season as he improved his grade to an 83.1 and only allowed 2 sacks and 12 Hurries.
pros: Always graded well for PFF never being below a 79. Improved every year while moving positions. True junior who was a 5 star recruit and the top of his class. Prototypical OT size at 6’6 315. Very good athlete, moves very fluid for a big man and can play in space. Good zone blocker, can reach guys very well with his athleticism.
cons: One year of starting at Tackle where he will be in the NFL. Technique needs work, likes to shoot hands wide and allow guys into his chest. Not a powerful lineman, not moving people in a gap scheme and his anchor is average. Plays off balance too often, feet stop too often and he is left lunging. Loses to the inside far too often, needs to play half the man better.
take: Johnson is a highly thought of prospect but he needs some serious work. He’s the type of player you draw up to play the position but he is lacking the technique and play strength as of now. He has the tools to be a top LT in the league but he’s a far way from it currently.
OT Broderick Jones Georgia 81
info: Jones was the 1b to Paris Johnsons 1a in the 2020 recruiting class. Similarly, to Johnson, Jones decided to stay local and go to his home state Georgia Bulldogs. He didn’t play much his freshman year but in the championship run in 2021 he got significant playing time getting 438 snaps. He came in to 2022 as the starting LT playing every game and only letting up 9 pressures on 470 pass blocks.
pros: True junior and a high 5 star recruit. Solid power and athleticism, has plays where he over powers LBs and runs to block in space. Wants to finish his blocks, has the dog in him to end the play with the defender on the ground. Reps where he wins the hand fighting game.
cons: 6’4 and not the longest tackle, routinely has issues with longer defenders getting in his pads. Stops his feet too often allowing a secondary rush to beat him. Off balance too often, lunges and loses leverage.
take: Jones is another talented 5 star recruit where you wish he could have played better. He needs to become more of a technician if he wants to win at the NFL level. If he learns how to play with more balance and keep defenders off his chest he can be a great tackle.
OT Darnell Wright Tennessee 80
info: 2,746 career snaps 65 RBLK 80.2 PBLK 8 pressures.
pros: Started at both left and right tackle. Good size at 6’6 335. Pretty good hands, the placement is good and has a strong grip. Strong overall player, can move guys and anchor well in pass pro.
cons: Not an athlete, is very mediocre in space and has trouble working to the 2nd level. Waist bender, doesn’t move his feet well and leans on guys.
take: Wright is your classic big guy that can handle power but speed can get him. He’s not athletic enough to be one of the top tackles in the NFL but he can certainly start for a team.
OT Cody Mauch North Dakota St 77
info: 2,461 career snaps 90.1 RBLK 81.7 PBLK 9 pressures.
pros: My man looks like a lineman, 2 missing teeth and long hair. Graded very well for PFF, 90.8 overall grade in 2022 with only 9 pressures. Improved every year getting stronger and better. Got that dawg in him, wants to finish ever block with the defender on the ground. Some impressive run blocking reps that make you belive he has the power to play in the NFL.
cons: Definitely undersized, at just 303 pounds and short arms (32 inches) it will be tough to handle NFL power. 5th year player that already had to add so much size on his frame. Very sloppy feet in pass pro, the base gets way too narrow and his sets are not the best. Plays very high, need to sink his hips more to get better leverage.
take: Mauch is a solid athlete even after putting on so much weight in his college career. He’s a tenacious run blocker that has upside, but his technique and power are just huge question marks. He’s a solid developmental tackle to have, once he cleans up his technique he could be a starter.
OT Matthew Bergeron Syracuse 77
info: 2,539 career snaps 69 RBLK 80.9 PBLK 12 pressures.
pros: Improved over his 4 year career at Syracuse while getting a lot of experience. Has NFL size at 6’5 322 with 33.5 inch arms. Solid in pass pro because he’s got solid size and decent athleticism. Good at picking up stunts and games from the DL.
cons: Loves to hold, a lot of missed holding calls on his tape. Inconsistent technique, oversets too much and doesn’t play with a strong posture leading him to lose balance. Not a mauler in the run game. Wasted motion with his punches, loads up hands and exposes his chest.
take: Bergeron has the size and movement skills you look for in an OT. Like most college OT’s there’s a lot he needs to work on technique wise but he’s a smart player that already has played solid. In a few years he could be a starting OT if he continues to develop.
OT Tyler Steen Alabama 76
info: 3,057 snaps 64.7 RBLK 74.4 PBLK 23 pressures.
pros: 6’5 315 and played at Bama, has the makeup of a solid tackle prospect. Played a lot of SEC football and was solid as a freshman and from both RT and LT. Shows the ability to have perfect pass sets with very good hands. Good IQ recognizing blitzes and DL stunts.
cons: Revery speed isn’t the best, can get his feet tangled at times. Power is lacking, can get pushed back too easily and doesn’t create much movement in the run game.
take: Steen is probably one of the most NFL ready tackles in this class. He’s very experienced and it seems Bama’s coaching has paid off with him showing great reps in pass pro. He’s missing the high end physical traits to be a dominating tackle but he certainly can play at the next level.
OT Zion Nelson Miami 74
info: 2,452 snaps 65 RBLK 85.3 PBLK 15 pressures.
pros: Was the starting LT for Miami as a true freshman in 2019. Improved greatly from his freshman year becoming a formidable tackle by his true junior year. Had a solid pass blocking game against Jermaine Johnson in 2021. Moves at an elite level for a LT, he’s so smooth and fast in pass pro.
cons: 2022 season was negated by a knee injury. Needs to add strength, the anchor wasn’t enough in 2021. Needs to work on hand placement to avoid defenders getting to his chest.
take: Nelson would have been benefited from a big time senior year which he was on track for. He already flashed his potential by showing with great movement skills and ability to get the job done in pass pro. All he needs to do is work on the anchor of his in pass pro because if he can do that we are looking at a top tier pass protector.
OT Blake Freeland BYU 75
info: 2,690 career snaps 87.9 RBLK 90.7 PBLK 7 pressures.
pros: 91 PFF grade in 2022, he has consistently graded well in PFFs system. Good length, 6’8 with 35 inch arms can keep defenders away from him. Smooth pass protector, can mirror pretty well and get hands on defenders. Smart in pass pro, see’s stunts well and can pass them off.
cons: He’s slim at 6’8 305, he can get out leveraged and bull rushed. A little soft at times, he gets pushed and thrown around a little too much. Weird pass set with his feet, needs to be re worked.
take: Freeland will be interesting to see if he pans out in the NFL. His style worked for him at BYU but the power and length of the NFL may get to him. He has the length and pass blocking ability to give teams hope but he needs to continue to work on his feet and strength.
OT Carter Warren Pitt 74
info: 2,768  snaps 67.6 RBLK 76.6 PBLK 25 pressures. 6’5 323 with 35 arms.
pros: Perfect tackle size, 35 inch arms at 323. 4 year starter and a team captain. Solid athlete, can explode off the ball. Uses his hands well, gets his hands on him fast.
cons: He missed nearly all of 2022 with an injury. Pad level is extremely high, even in his stance. Doesn’t look like he has the leg strength you would want.
take: Warren had a very sad ending to his career, He had a season ending injury his final year as a team captain. He has the size, athleticism and experience, he’s just missing the strength and to fix his leverage.
OT Kadeem Telfort UAB 74
info: 1,883 snaps 72.9 RBLK 73.6 PBLK 10 pressures. 6’7 319 with 35 7/8 arms.
pros: Amazing build, 6’7 320 with 36 inch arms. Strong and athletic for his size, he moves surprising well.
cons: Legal trouble. Struggled against his one power 5 team. Looks a little unnatural, inefficient steps. May not have the best IQ now.
take: Telfort is a big project but the payoff could be huge. He moves very well for his size and has power to his game along with some solid hand usage already. He’s still raw with his feet and may not have a ton of experience but he could be a good starting OL.
OT Malaesala Aumavae-Laulu Oregon 74
info: 2,007 snaps 76 RBLK 77.8 PBLK 14 pressures. 6’5 322 with 33 7/8 arms.
pros: Thick good build. Solid in pass pro, smooth and can get hands on. Good power, can knock guys to the ground on double teams.
cons: Doesn’t do well with speed, can get ran right by. Not the best balance, bends at the waist and leans too much.
take: Aumavae-Laulu may need to move to guard, but if he does he make become a good NFL starter. He’s food in pass pro where he is smooth and uses his hands well and has good power in the run game. He struggles with the speed rushers that get him off balance.
OT Jaelyn Duncan Maryland 73
info: 2,631 career snaps 61.9 RBLK 67.6 PBLK 28 pressures.
pros: Solid size, athleticism and strength combo. Solid hand usage, like to go outside in pass pro but he’s strong enough to do it.
cons: On the thinner side at the senior bowl, 6'5 298. Never really dominated in his 5 years at Maryland. 3 worst games were by far the worst and against good competition. Some of the worst balance I’ve ever seen, constantly on the ground and lunging. Loves to hold, he was flagged over 10 times.
take: Duncan is 100% physical tools and almost no production currently. He’s not a total train wreck in the technique department but after 5 years with his ability you really want to see more than what he’s giving you. If he can figure it all out he could be a plus NFL starter.
OT Braeden Daniels Utah 71
info: 2,942 career snaps 65.6 RBLK 78.7 PBLK 15 pressures.
pros: Solid length, 33.5 inch arms and an 82.5 wing span. 2020/2021 88 and 89 PFF RBLK grades, graded well in 2021. Versatile, played LT LG and RT. He’s a good athlete that can mirror defenders and handle speed rushers. Good at keeping defenders away from him with his length.
cons: He’s very small at 6’4 297 he’s in the bottom 10% for weight. Took a step back in 2022 from an 84 to a 72 PFF grade when he moved to LT. Sloppy feet and inconsistent hands, will lower them and let guys in his chest and loses the hand fight a lot.
take: Daniels is a developmental tackle even though he has almost 3,000 career snaps. His feet need work as well as his sets and his hand fighting as well. The athlete is there though, he’s a solid lineman with good length he just needs coaching.
OT Asim Richards North Carolina 72
info: 2,522 snaps 53.1 RBLK 75.5 PBLK 20 pressures. 6’4 307 with 34 1/8 arms.
pros: 3 year starter with solid length. Solid hand usage, gets his hands on defenders well and will re fit. Has the OL mentality, will finish a block if he can.
cons: Plays incredibly high, he has no leverage. Sloppy feet, gets to narrow and moves a little slow. Bad run blocker, he cant move people in the run game.
take: Richards is a raw OT which is concerning because he is a 3 year starter. He has great length and enough athleticism and power to play but it doesn’t show often. He plays high and with bad feet, but even with those flaws he pass blocked pretty well meaning if a team can clean that up he can be a starting OT.
OT Jordan Mcfadden Clemson 72
info: 2,956 snaps 67 RBLK 78.7 PBLK 13 pressures. 6’2 295 with 34 arms.
pros: had 3 previous seasons of 80+ PFF grade. Has great length for his height, 6’2 with 34 inch arms. Has some nastiness to his game, will put a guy in the ground. Solid technique, solid feet and hands.
cons: Had his worst year in 2022 by 10 PFF grade. Sub 300 pounds, needs to add mass and maybe move to guard. Balance is mediocre, he gets thrown around too much.
take: Mcfadden had a very good college career at Clemson where he was battle tested. He played on both sides of the line and played well every year. He’s got the ability but there are too many reps he gets off balance that needs to get cleaned up.
OT TJ Bass Oregon 71
info: 2,211 snaps 78.1 RBLK 73.4 PBLK 20 pressures. 6’4 320.
pros: Graded well back-to-back years as the starter. High IQ, see’s stunts well and plays with patience. Great hand usage, will always fight to re fit. Has a sloid anchor, you have to go around him.
cons: Lacks the length to play tackle, he gets guys on his chest too often. Not a plus athlete, struggles to get off the ball fast. Plays high through contact, won’t move people because of his leverage.
take: Bass has his physical limitations, he’s not very long or athletic so a move to guard may be needed. He’s a technician that doesn’t lose often and plays very hard which is a good combo.
OT McClendon Curtis Chattanooga 72
info: 1,891 snaps 80.3 RBLK 90.9 PBLK 7 pressures. 6’6 331 with 35 arms.
pros: Perfect OT build, 6’6 330 with 35 inch arms. Played both Guard and Tackle.
cons: Played at Chattanooga, the competition level was low. Mediocre athlete with poor balance. Bad hands, holdy and doesn’t fit his hands well.
take: Curtis is 100% a project, he has nearly no technique. He will be drafted on traits alone because he’s a specimen but the play isn’t there.
OT Wanya Morris Oklahoma 71
info: 1,747 snaps 76.9 RBLK 73.9 PBLK 8 pressures. 6’5 317 with 35 5/8th arms.
pros: Nearly the perfect build at 6’5 317 with 35.5 inch arms.  Improved greatly from his freshman season. Former 5 star recruit. Decent strength and athleticism.
cons: Didn’t start for a while. Awful technique, his hand placement is all over the place. His feet are sloppy, bad sets and gets way too narrow. Bad balance.
take: Morris is a disappointment, the former 5 star built in a lab tackle never played that well. His first 3 years he struggled mightily before finding a bit of a groove in 2022. He has it all physically but his technique is awful, he has bad feet and balance which will take some time to work out.
OT Nick Saldiveri Old Dominion 70
info: 2,416 snaps 61.5 RBLK 85.1 PBLK 18 pressures. 6’6 311 with 33 3/8 arms.
pros: Decent build at 6’6 311 with 33.5 inch arms. Pretty good athlete, can move well for the size.
cons: Strength is not there, wont move anyone in the run game. Got beat bad 1v1 at the senior bowl. Played against lower level competition.
take: Saldiveri will probably be a good backup in the NFL. He’s got good size and athleticism but he got exposed in pass pro at the senior bowl. He’s not very strong so he needs to add strength to be an NFL OL.
OT John Ojukwu Boise St 70
info: 3,588 snaps 69.6 RBLK 78.1 PBLK 14 pressures. 6’5 317 with 34 3/8 arms.
pros: Great build, long arms and good size. Improved every year. Has a solid anchor, can stop a bull rush if needed.
cons: Never played great in a lower level of competition than power 5. Foot work needs a lot of work. Plays with bad balance because a lack of technique.
take: Ojukwu looks like a great LT if you look at him pre game. Once the game starts you realize why he’s not a 1st round pick. He’s a project for sure, his balance is bad because his feet are bad, but if he learns he can be very good.
OT Richard Gouraige Florida 69
info: 2,941 snaps 65.7 RBLK 78.9 PBLK 14 pressures. 6’5 308 with 34 arms.
pros: Good build for a tackle, 6’5 310 with 34 inch arms. 4 years of starting experience that got better every year. Decent technique, feet are set well and throws hands well.
cons: Bad overall athlete, he bends at the waist and loses balance. Slow feet that has an issue trying to mirror edge rushers.
take: Gouraige is an experienced tackle with a good build and decent technique. That makes him sound like a sure fire player to draft but he is so slow and un athletic that he may never get to the point where he can play in the NFL.
OT Warren McClendon Georgia 69
info: 2,215 snaps 64.3 RBLK 82.1 PBLK 8 pressures. 6’4 190 with 34 arms.
pros: Decent length with 34 inch arms. Moves well for an offensive lineman. 3 year starter for the 2 time national championship Bull Dogs.
cons: Sub 300 pounds, he has a slight frame. Really rough technique, his feet and hands are ugly in pass pro. Bad balance, lunges way too often.
take: McClendon has accomplished a lot in his career with Georgia, helping anchor a stout national championship OL. He has the experience and PFF grades to give you hope, but his tape doesn’t match the grade. He’s rough with his technique and balance which will lead to no NFL success unless he fixes those issues.
OT Ryan Hayes Michigan 68
info: 2,114 snaps 72.1 RBLK 76.9 PBLK 11 pressures. 6’6 305 with 32 ¾ arms
pros: Solid experience, played LT for Michigan over the last 2 years. Solid strength, can move people in the run game.
cons: Bad build, 6’6 305 with 32 inch arms, he’s tall with no length or size. Slow feet that can get beat with speed. Not flexible, a bit of a waist bender.
take: Hayes had a solid college career, being the 2 year starter at LT for Michigan and played pretty well. In the NFL he will struggle because of his physical limitations, he’s not long and not a plus athlete. He will fight to be a backup tackle in the league.
OT Alex Palczewski Illinois 69
info: 4,390 snaps 79.8 RBLK 81.8 PBLK 11 pressures. 6’6 314 with 33 3/8 arm.
pros: Unreal amount of starting experience, he was a 6 year starter with over 4,000 snaps. Graded above 70 in his last 5 seasons. Solid feet, doesn’t lose his base easily.
cons: Older prospect, has played 6 seasons in college. Holds heavily, his hands will hug the defender in pass pro. Plays extremely high.
take: Palczewski has an absurd amount of snaps, over 400 in his career and understands a lot of football. He’s got good feet but the other physical parts of his game aren’t great. He holds every time he gets hands on and he plays ridiculously high which wont work.
OT Dalton Wagner Arkansas 68
info: 2,788 snaps 76.6 RBLK 78.2 PBLK 21 pressures. 6’8 321 with 34 arms.
pros: Has solid power, can move guys when he gets hands on. Good size.
cons: Waist bender, has issues with balance and movement skills. Can’t handle any speed, his feet are slow.
take: Wagner is a big strong RT that was a solid player in the SEC. He’s not an athlete though, his feet are stuck in mud and he can’t handle speed.
OT Earl Bostick Kansas 68
info: 2,267 snaps 53.1 RBLK 72.4 PBLK 16 pressures. 6’6 311 with 33 5/8 arms.
pros: Solid tackle build. Solid athlete, can move in space and reach guys. Decent pad level in pass pro, can bend.
cons: Graded below a 60 in 2022 and 2021. No power at impact, will struggle anchoring and definitely in the run game.
take: Bostick has the size and athleticism to make it in the NFL, the tools are there. He struggled a little in college especially in the run game where he can’t create movement.
OT Quinton Barrow Grand Valley St 68
info: 6’5 322 with 34 ¼ arms.
pros: Great size.
cons: Played a lower level of competition. Not much film on him.
take: I couldn’t find much film on him but he’s got great size and should get a shot.
OT Colby Sorsdal William & Mary 67
info: 1,797 snaps 89.3 RBLK 83.7 PBLK 10 pressures. 6’6 301 with 32 ¾ arms.
pros: Great final year with an 89.9 PFF grade. Smooth in pass pros, good base to his game.
cons: Played at William and Mary. Leaves the inside move open too often. Plays too upright, will struggle with power.
take: Sorsdal will have a tough time in the NFL with power and length. He played well against easy competition but will have a tough time with the jump in talent.
OT Connor Galvin Baylor 67
info: 3,554 snaps 74.3 RBLK 77.1 PBLK 16 pressures. 6’6 293 with 32 1/8 arms.
pros: A lot of experience and solid grades. Smooth offensive lineman, he has solid technique and doesn’t look out of place.
cons: Got smoked in the east west shrine game. Bad build, he’s too lean with short arms. Plays way to high with not much bend. Doesn’t have power to his game, will get bulled and wont create movement.
take: Galvin is a very experienced OL that has played a lot of ball and it shows by the way he moves. He just lacks the power and build to be an NFL OL.
OT Kilian Zierer Auburn 67
info: 1,152 snaps 57.4 RBLK 71 PBLK 19 pressures. 6’7 304 with 34 1/8 arms.
pros: Solid tackle length. Solid athlete, can move well in space.
cons: One year starter, not much experience. Didn’t have a good season. Slow feet, balance is bad because of it. Not much power.
take: Zierer has the size and athleticism you look for, but he just didn’t play well. He has limited play strength and slow feet. He wont survive in the NFL with the strength and technique he plays with now.
OT Mason Brooks Ole Miss 67
info: 2,188 snaps 79.5 RBLK 86.3 PBLK 0 pressures. 6’5 309 with 33 ¾ arms.
pros: Solid size and played well when he got in.
cons: Couldn’t start at Ole Miss.
take: Brooks couldn’t crack the starting lineup. He’s got the size but he didn’t play in 2022.
OT Trevor Reid Louisville 67
info: 1,347 snaps 58.3 RBLK 71.7 PBLK 13 pressures. 6’4 297 with 34 ½.
pros: Good length and athleticism.
cons: Sloppy technique, hands and feet are not refined. No power, will get thrown around in run game. Sub 300 pounds.
take: Reid has the length and athleticism to make an NFL training camp but he will need to add mass and develop to stay in the NFL.
OT Luke Haggard Indiana 66
info: 1,940 snaps 59.4 RBLK 72.8 PBLK 20 pressures. 6’6 297 with 33 1/8 arms.
pros: Has ok length and athleticism.
cons: On the leaner side at sub 300. Plays extremely high, almost fully straight up.
take: Haggard isn’t good, he plays high and has no mass behind him.
OT Mark Evans Arkansas-Pinebluff 66
info: 1,894 snaps 63 RBLK 64.4 PBLK 19 pressures. 6’2 293 with 32 3/8 arms.
pros: Good athlete that is a 4 year starter. Gives good effort in the run game.
cons: He’s too small.
take: Evans is too small to play, he’s 6’2 293 with 32 inch arms, he wont make it.
OT Theo Benedet British Columbia 66
info: 6’5 303 with 32 arms.
pros: He has played football.
cons: No length and no film.
take: No film, but no length.
OT Jacky Chen Pace 65
info: 6’5 302 with 33 ¾ arms.
pros: Decent Build.
cons: Havent watched.
take: No take.
