DL Jalen Carter Georgia 93
info: 32 pressures 3 sacks 21 tackles 91.2 RDEF 89.1 PRSH.
pros: True junior that was a 5 star coming out of high school and has improved every year. Arguably the most dominated defender on a defense that produced 5 1st round picks. Back to back 89+ pass rush grades with a 24% win rate on true pass sets. Back to back national champion, he has had much success in his career. Great power, he walked Florida’s guard back easily. Plays with great leverage off the ball, he’s so quick and low off the ball he gets the upper hand on OL. Uses hand swipes well in the pass game and extends in the run game to shed blockers. Strong upper body, can toss OL off balance easily.
cons: He’s not the biggest DL, could struggle to hold up in the run game if quickness doesn’t work. Has not played over 400 snaps in a year. Probably not the best 2 gap players, way better at shooting gaps. Likes his go to outside move on the guard with a swim too much maybe, not many counters off of that.
take: Carter was the most dominate player in college football last year. He really doesn’t have weaknesses, the only things are he didn’t play a bunch of snaps and he probably needs to add more pass rush moves. He’s physically on another level with his explosiveness and it showed every play he was out there. He will be an All Pro at some point and the best player on his DL.
DL Bryan Bresee Clemson 78
info: 24 pressures 3 sacks 9 tackles 63 RDEF 82 PRSH.
pros: Former number 1 recruit over Jalen Carter that played well as a true freshman. 6’5 300 and a great athlete, has the physical tools. Good athlete for his size and can be a problem on stunts and free rushes. Shows plays where he flashes good pass rush moves.
cons: Under 1,000 career snaps, missed most of 2021. A lot of stunts from the Clemson D that isn’t how he will play much in the NFL. Shorter arms than you would like, can let OL into his pads and dictate the block. Pad level is too high, plays upright. He has been hurt every season, injuries are a concern. Not your every down solid player way too flashy.
take: Bresee had a somewhat disappointing career, he flashed as a freshman but didn’t really build on that. He’s a talented DL with the size and strength but he’s missing consistency. He can come in and be a rotational piece on the DL but if he develops he could be a good starter.
DL Siaki Ika Baylor 79
info: 18 pressures 0 sacks 20 tackles 69.1 RDEF 76.2 PRSH.
pros: Great size at 6’4 358, he can easily play the nose. Rare combo of size and quickness, can move like he’s 300 pounds not 350. Fires off the ball low and plays with a strong base.
cons: A nose tackle only most likely which is going to drive his stock down. Can get moved against double teams, doesn’t brace for the second OL well.
take: Ika is the prototypical NT with his large frame and strong base he can hold down the middle of a defense. He’s also a lot quicker than you would think at that size, he can pull out a spin move or a quick swim as well. He should be able to step in and play NT in the NFL and only get better from here.
