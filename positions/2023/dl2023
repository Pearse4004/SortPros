DL Jalen Carter Georgia 88
info: 32 pressures 3 sacks 21 tackles 91.2 RDEF 89.1 PRSH. 6'3 314 with 33 1/2 arms. Carter was a 5 star recruit coming out of Apopka FL where he was compared to former Apopka resident Warren Sapp. The star DL was between some Florida and SEC schools and decided to go join the power house Georgia. As a true freshman he played in all 10 games and even caught a TD from Stetson against Tennessee. In 2021 he broke out in a loaded DL with Jordan Davis and Devante Wyatt forming probably the best interior DL in CFB history. He was 2nd team All SEC and helped the Dogs win the national championship over Alabama with 6 pressures in that game. He continued to show how dominate he was in 2022, continuing to improve in the run game and dominate guards in the pass game. He was named an All American and helped Georgia win another national championship.
pros: True junior that was a 5 star coming out of high school and has improved every year. Arguably the most dominated defender on a defense that produced 5 1st round picks. Back to back 89+ pass rush grades with a 24% win rate on true pass sets. Back to back national champion, he has had much success in his career. Great power, he walked Florida’s guard back easily. Plays with great leverage off the ball, he’s so quick and low off the ball he gets the upper hand on OL. Uses hand swipes well in the pass game and extends in the run game to shed blockers. Strong upper body, can toss OL off balance easily.
cons: He’s not the biggest DL, could struggle to hold up in the run game if quickness doesn’t work. Has not played over 400 snaps in a year. Probably not the best 2 gap players, way better at shooting gaps. Likes his go to outside move on the guard with a swim too much maybe, not many counters off of that.
take: Carter was the most dominate player in college football last year. He really doesn’t have weaknesses, the only things are he didn’t play a bunch of snaps and he probably needs to add more pass rush moves. He’s physically on another level with his explosiveness and it showed every play he was out there. He will be an All Pro at some point and the best player on his DL.
DL Calijah Kancey Pitt 80
info: 47 pressures 8 sacks 19 tackles 80.9 RDEF 92.4 PRSH. 6'1 281 with 30 5/8 arms. 47 pressures 8 sacks 19 tackles 80.9 RDEF 92.4 PRSH.
pros: Great athlete for the position, so quick off of the ball. Played all 3 years at a high level. ACC player of the year and an all American. Can swim and sidestep then bend around guards like nothing, they can’t handle his speed. Actually held up to double teams really well. Great leverage, gets under OL and can bull them back.
cons: Wildly undersized at 6 foot 280. If a good OL gets hands on the rep is over, he’s small.
take: Kancey is the closest thing to Aaron Donald I’ve seen, he’s just a weaker and smaller Donald. That’s not a slight though, he’s still plenty strong and consistently abused OL. As long as a team doesn’t ask him to sit and occupy a gap or 2 gap he’s going to be an impact player.
DL Bryan Bresee Clemson 79
info: 24 pressures 3 sacks 9 tackles 63.4 RDEF 82 PRSH. 6'5 305 with 32 1/2 arms. Breese was the number 1 overall recruit playing at Damascus HS in MD. He had 35 sacks in HS with 134 career tackles and capped off his career with a state championship. After being named the Gatorade player of the year he committed to Clemson over every other power 5 school where he would play as a true freshman. He racked up 4 sacks and was named the ACC defensive freshman of the year and was an All ACC player. He only played in 4 games in 2021 after sufferring an injury to his knee and missed the rest of the season. He came back in 2022 and looked a lot like his freshman year and delt with a lot of adversity. He had a kidney inffection as well as dealt with the trauma of his sister having brain cancer. He battled through the season and finished the season with 3 sacks and an ACC championship.
pros: Former number 1 recruit over Jalen Carter that played well as a true freshman. 6’5 300 and a great athlete, has the physical tools. Good athlete for his size and can be a problem on stunts and free rushes. Shows plays where he flashes good pass rush moves.
cons: Under 1,000 career snaps, missed most of 2021. A lot of stunts from the Clemson D that isn’t how he will play much in the NFL. Shorter arms than you would like, can let OL into his pads and dictate the block. Pad level is too high, plays upright. He has been hurt every season, injuries are a concern. Not your every down solid player way too flashy.
take: Bresee had a somewhat disappointing career, he flashed as a freshman but didn’t really build on that. He’s a talented DL with the size and strength but he’s missing consistency. He can come in and be a rotational piece on the DL but if he develops he could be a good starter.
DL Adetomiwa Adebawore Northwestern 78
info: 31 pressures 6 sacks 28 tackles 68.3 RDEF 80.3 PRSH. 6’2 284 with 34 arms.
pros: Solid stout build at 6’2 with long arms. Good athlete, gets off the ball quick and can shoot gaps. Good hands in the run game, can keep guards away from him and toss them off to make the play. Good hustle player, chases QBs with effort and makes tackles down the field. Versatile player, can play edge on run downs then the interior in the pass game.
cons: On the slimmer side at sub 290, he is a tweener. Has trouble holding up to power, can get bullied a bit in the run game. Won’t be able to rush off the edge, tackles are too good for him to beat. No pass rush plan, just tries to win with pure athleticism. No bend on the edge, can’t beat any NFL tackle to the outside.
take: Adebawore was the best DL on Northwestern for the last few years, he’s a long high motor player that makes plays in the backfield. He’s got good quickness and athleticism to his game for an interior DL but he’s a tweener, playing both edge and DL. His skillset makes him a chess piece for a DC, he can play the run great on early downs and be moved inside to rush on pass downs to maximize his ability.
DL Keeanu Benton Wisconsin 78
info: 28 pressures 6 sacks 25 tackles 65.2 RDEF 83.5 PRSH. 6’3 312 with 33 ¾ arms.
pros: Great build, good size with solid length. Great power on initial contact, has an innate ability to create movement. Flashes dominate quick reps where he beats people badly on the snap. Big guy that can hold his ground and make a play in the run game.
cons: Looks like he doesn’t have a plan out there, just goes full speed at a lineman. Not a great athlete, could struggle to chase down QBs. Inconsistent, not sure if usage or him but he stands at the line a lot.
take: Benton has some stupid power, he can absolutely toss OL and make plays in the backfield. He’s got some quicks to his game as well making him dangerous in the pass game. He’s just got to play like his highlight reel consistently to be a serious star in the NFL because he has that kind of talent.
DL Keion White Georgia Tech 77
info: 41 pressures 7 sacks 33 tackles 78.7 RDEF 75.6 PRSH. 6'5 285 with 34 arms.
pros: Solid size, at 6’5 280 he a big edge that can handle the edge.  Played well for GT, he was a physical player with a high motor. Good power for an edge, has a bull rush and strong hands. Could play interior and be a solid rusher from there. Freaky athlete at his size, is very strong and surprisingly athletic.
cons: Already 24 years old. A bit of a tweener, he’s not a good enough athlete to win on the edge. Wasn’t dominate even at 24 and 280, he has a bull but its not special. Not long enough to win on the edge with his long arm.
take: White is all potential at this point, he is raw in the pass game and only had one year of power 5 play. He is a physical freak at 280 with the strength to play interior and just enough to play edge. He isn’t a starter day 1 and needs a lot of work but he could end up being a very good DL.
DL Siaki Ika Baylor 77
info: 18 pressures 0 sacks 20 tackles 69.1 RDEF 76.2 PRSH. 6'4 358 with 32 3/8 arms.
pros: Great size at 6’4 358, he can easily play the nose. Rare combo of size and quickness, can move like he’s 300 pounds not 350. Fires off the ball low and plays with a strong base.
cons: A nose tackle only most likely which is going to drive his stock down. Can get moved against double teams, doesn’t brace for the second OL well.
take: Ika is the prototypical NT with his large frame and strong base he can hold down the middle of a defense. He’s also a lot quicker than you would think at that size, he can pull out a spin move or a quick swim as well. He should be able to step in and play NT in the NFL and only get better from here.
DL Mazi Smith Michigan 77
info: 25 pressures 1 sack 38 tackles 81 RDEF 68 PRSH. 6'3 323 with 33 3/4 arms.
pros: Freaky athlete, was Feldmans number 1 payer at 337 he did 22 reps of 325 and has a sub 7 3 cone. Over 600 snaps in 2022, he can play a lot of snaps every game. Unreal play strength, just tosses OL around.
cons: 2 career sacks even though he is a freaky athlete. No pass rush to speak of, barely uses hands and doesn’t try to bull the OL often. Terrible get off, just kind of stands straight up.
take: For a 4th year senior he is so underdeveloped. He’s a physical freak, god only made so many people as strong as he is but he doesn’t use it well. He’s got no pass rush, barely gets off the ball and no hand technique. If he would develop he could be unstoppable.
DL Zacch Pickens South Carolina 76
info: 19 pressures 3 sacks 31 tackles 60.7 RDEF 75 PRSH. 6’4 300 with 34 1/8 arms.
pros: 5 star DL recruit that played all 4 years in college. Good size and length. Plays his gap very well, stout in the run game and engages OL very well with good hands. Strong hands and have a very nice quick swim.
cons: Gets surprised with pull blocks sometimes, doesn’t anticipate the down block. Not the best athlete, not going to chase any play down. Not much off a pass rusher right now, bulls into a guy and then will try to rip away. Inconsistent dominate reps, they come far and few between.
take: Pickens flashes the ability to be a good NFL starter on the DL. He’s long with a powerful punch and quick hands to beat OL very quick off the snap. He’s just had a sort of disappointing career after being a 5 star recruit you would like to see him be more consistent. He will easily be a good rotational DL to start his career with the upside of a good starting DT.
DL Moro Ojomo Texas 76
info: 26 pressures 5 sacks 19 tackles 91.4 RDEF 84.1 PRSH. 6’2 293 with 34 3/8 arms.
pros: Good length, he has good leverage at 6’2 with over 34 inch arms. Broke out in 2022, jumped to a 90 PFF grade. Very good against the run and pass. Good effort, fights through blocks to try to make the play. Uses hands decently, strong hands that can throw lineman off him.
cons: Not the thickest build, sub 300 pounds. Will struggle against double teams with his mass.
take: Ojomo is being slept on this draft, he had a great 2022 season and has the body type you look for. He’s a little undersized so he needs to continue to add mass to hold up in the run game but his effort makes up for it. He has great length, strong hands and good quickness to be a disruptive player.
DL Gervon Dexter Florida 75
info: 25 pressures 2 sacks 36 tackles 70 RDEF 55.2 PRSH. 6'6 312 with 32 1/4 arms.
pros: True junior and a former 5 star, has potential to improve greatly. Good size at 6’6 312. Played over 600 snaps in 2022, he can play all game if needed. Good power to his game, can walk lineman back as well as hold his ground in the run game. Shows that he can put a pass rush move on the OL, may not be NFL level but he has a nice swim.
cons: Took a step back in 2022, his pass rush grade lowered below 60. Played a lot but also had plays where he looked tired and got no push. Plays very very high, needs to fire off the ball lower. Not a twitchy DL, he’s not going to wow any guard with a quick speed move.
take: Dexter is a prototypical 3 tech at 6’6 312 he can bull rush and hold up in the run game. He’s not there yet as a NFL starter, he plays high and isn’t advanced with his hands. If you give him time and coaching though he can turn into a very good starting DL.
DL Kobie Turner Wake Forest 75
info: 34 pressures 3 sacks 27 tackles 93.1 RDEF 88.8 PRSH. 6’3 290 with 32 arms.
pros: 4 years of high level PFF grading. Good testing, 7.09 3 cone and 31 Bench. Good athlete that can bend well and has good quickness for the interior. Shoots gaps well and reacts to blocks fast.
cons: Played at Richmond for 4 years before wake. Not the biggest or longest DL. May struggle with double teams or power.
take: NA
DL Byron Young Alabama 74
info: 28 pressures 4 sacks 30 tackles 75.6 RDEF 74.6 PRSH. 6’3 297 with 34 arms.
pros: Great build, 6’3 300 with long arms. Powerful rusher, has a good bull rush and can collapse the pocket. Quick player, can win with quick swims and a good get off. Uses his hands well in the run game, extends to get OL off him and locate the ball.
cons: Would like to see him hold up stronger against the power run. Does too many spins when trying to get off blocks. Not a great athlete, struggles to move very well.
take: Young us a typical Alabama DL, a big strong guy that gets off the ball well and wins with power. He’s good in both the run and the pass game using his long arms to help him win and keep OL off balance. He’s just not the best athlete so the upside is limited a bit, he can still be very good but just not dominate.
DL Keondre Coburn Texas 74
info: 31 pressures 4 sacks 13 tackles 74.8 RDEF 79.3 PRSH. 6’1 344 with 31 ½ arms.
pros: Big strong nose tackle at 344 pounds. Broke out in 2022, added pass rush to his game. Holds up against double teams pretty well. Solid quickness, has quick hands and a solid first step.
cons: Very short arms, sub 32 inches. Not a good athlete, looks like he struggles to move past his first step.
take: Coburn is a solid run defender, using his 344 pounds to hold his ground in the run game. He adds a good first step and quick hands to make him a more disruptive player than most NTs. He’s just not the athlete and doesn’t have the length to go high in the draft.
DL Karl Brooks Bowling Green 72
info: 69 pressures 12 sacks 32 tackles 90.3 RDEF 92 PRSH. 6’3 303 with 32 ¼ arms.
pros: Ridiculous 93 DEF grade. Solid pass rusher, gives effort and swipes hands well.
cons: Not the best length, 32 inch arms. Way too many edge snaps on his tape, he’s certainly not athletic enough for that. No experience at the interior and needs a lot of work there to be NFL caliber. Not a good athlete even though he played on the edge.
take: Brooks is a pass rushing project in the NFL. At bowling green he played so much edge it looks like he doesn’t know how to play DL and it will take some coaching to get him there. In the meantime he can be subbed in during pass rush situations because he gives a lot of effort and uses his hands well in the pass game.
DL Jaquelin Roy LSU 72
info: 27 pressures 2 sacks 39 tackles 68.4 RDEF 70.6 PRSH. 6’4 315.
pros: Has a nice swim move to his game. Great size, he’s a hard dude to move. Solid athleticism, can get upfield well for a NT.
cons: Loses hos gap in the run game too easy. Doesn’t knock OL back and establish the LoS.
take: NA
DL Tyler Lacy Oklahoma St 71
info: 17 pressures 3 sacks 14 tackles 87.4 RDEF 68.8 PRSH. 6’4 279 with 33 ¼ arms.
pros: Good against the run, can stack and shed tackles well. Moves well for a DT, can move quickly down the line to close in on a ball carrier. Solid hands, placement is good and strong.
cons: Poor athletic testing for a sub 280. Will play DL but is a little lighter. Complete projection to the DL, played on the edge. Will need to add strength to hold up in the interior.
take: NA
DL Jerrod Clark Costal Carolina 70
info: 28 pressures 4 sacks 22 tackles 74.9 RDEF 77 PRSH. 6’3 343 with 33 7/8 arms.
pros: Great build, he has great length and size at 340 pounds. Good anchor, can hold down the middle of a defense. Has a good bull rush.
cons: Slow off the ball, wont be much of a disruptive source. He put on 85 pounds in one year, it’s not all good weight for sure. Doesn’t have great hands, doesn’t extend and keep guys off him.
take: Clark is a big man that is hard to move and hard to stop. He’s 340 pounds (80 of it was gained in one year) so he’s a prototypical nose tackle, but he lost a lot of athleticism by doing that. He wont be a disruptive force from the middle but he can be a stout solid NT.
DL DJ Dale Alabama 69
info: 14 pressures 3 sacks 13 tackles 75.4 RDEF 79 PRSH. 6’1 302 with 32 ½ arms.
pros: Broke out in 2022, jumped from a 63 to 80 grade. Solid athlete with a high motor, fight to get past blocks. Solid run defending ability, has good leverage and hands to hold his gap.
cons: Not the longest DL, 6’1 and shorter arms. Was a part time player each year, never a starter. Needs to add a bit of mass to hold in the run game with the lack of length. Not much of a real pass rush, more of a high motor rush.
take: Dale is an undersized DL that wasn’t a starter at Alabama. He’s still a solid DL, he has good hand placement and plays hard to allow him to succeed in the SEC. He can be a solid rotational DL in the league.
DL PJ Mustipher Penn St 66
info: 4 pressures 1 sack 22 tackles 58.3 RDEF 56.9 PRSH. 6’4 320 with 32 ¾ arms.
pros: Was a leader for Penn St, 2 time team captain.
cons: Bad athlete, bad testing numbers. Slow off the ball, never will get to a guys pads first. No pass rushing, not athletic enough to bend around anyone.
take: NA
