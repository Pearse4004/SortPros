WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba Ohio St 90
info: Smith-Njigba was a 5 star coming out of Rockwall HS in TX where he put up absurd numbers and leaving the state of Texas to join Olave and Wilson in Ohio at OSU. in 2020 his true freshman season he played sparingly thanks to 3 top 15 picks but Jameson Williams left for Alabama the next year and he stepped into the slot role. His 2021 season was great, he caught 95 balls for 1,600 yards and 9 TDs with a 91.7 pff grade. Nothing was more impressive than what he did when he was the lone target in their bowl game where he put up 336 yards and 3 TDs. He let down OSU his senior year after he got hurt and only played 40 total snaps in 2022 and missed the CFP.
pros: Didn't have many contested catch snaps but he went 9/10 when he got them. Really good and natural hands, makes tough catches look simple. Really good out of breaks, sets up defenders well and accelerates out of the break. Great body control, can twist and readjust to any ball to make the catch.
cons: Missed so many games in 2022, he only had one season of actually playing. Played slot only with stars on the outside, a very easy situation. Doesn't have the best speed, wont run away from anyone. Never really had to deal with press.
take: Smith-Njigba would be a top 10 pick easily if he repeated hos 2021 performance, but he missed his senior season. He's got the Keenan Allen skill of getting open and making plays on the ball but is just lacking that top end speed. The ability to be a great number 1 receiver is there, but with the lack of pysical tools it is more of a risk than you would like.
WR Jordan Addison USC 84
info: Addison was a slightly built 4 star recruit out of Frederick MD where he decided to stay closer to home and enroll at Pitt with future 1st round pick Kenny Pickett. He made an immediate impact by catching 60 balls for 662 yards and was named a True Freshman All American. His Sophomore season blew that out of the water though, he caught 100 balls for 1,593 yards a 17 TDs which was enough to win him the Biletnikoff award. That season made him a hot commodity in the transfer portal where he teamed up with Caleb Williams to lead USC to a comeback season for the Trojans. He caught 59 balls for 875 yards and 8 TDs and was named 1st team All-PAC 12.
pros: Production alone is great, 3,130 career yards and a Biletnikoff award. Good speed, can burn DBs down the field. Fixed drop concerns in 2022, only dropped 2 balls and made a lot of nice catches. Quick in his routes, with the ball and off the line. Good balance, can get knocked around and stay on his feet. Good ball skills down the field, can track the ball well.
cons: Slim frame, at 180 pounds he can get pushed around with physicality and mess up timing. Would have liked to see more production in 2022 with Caleb Williams.
take: Addison is pretty close to Garrett Wilson coming out, both are undersized but so quick and good at the position it didn’t derail them. He can clearly produce while being the teams number 1 and I expect that to continue in the NFL.
WR Quentin Johnston TCU 81
info: Johnston was a high 4 star recruit coming out of Temple HS in TX where he originally committed to Texas. He ultimately decided to go to TCU as one of the highest WR recruits they ever got. His first season there he showed off some impressive deep ball skills racking up 487 yards and 22.1 YPC. In 2021 as a true sophomore he showed his big play ability again with spectacular catches and 604 receiving yards. He really broke out in 2022 where he got 1,067 receiving yards and was named 1st team big 12 and lead TCU to the national championship game.
pros: Great size at 6’4 215 and is 21 as a true junior. He is a walking big play, averaged 18.8 YPC over his career. Great with the ball in his hands, he broke 19 tackles in 2022. Physical freak, can fly at his size, runs past CBs easily. Strong with the ball, can stick a foot in the ground and shake off defenders.
cons: May be the next Kevin White, game may not translate. For a guy his size he only was at a 40% career contested catch rate. Had a 10% drop rate which for a top receiver is a little high. Not impressive out of breaks, will not be creating separation at the stem. Agility and twitch are not apart of his game, he moves a little slow when trying to make people miss
take: null
WR Josh Downs North Carolina 80
info: Downs was a 4 star recruit out of Suwanee GA where he was an All State player as well as a triple jump and long jump star. He committed to North Carolina to play with Sam Howell and learn behind Dyamni Brown. After Brown went to the NFL Downs stepped up and became the teams number 1 catching 101 balls for 1,335 yards and solidified himself as one of the nations top WRs. He came back in 2022 and caught 94 yards for 1,029 yards and 11 TDs which was good enough to be an All American.
pros: Back to back 1,000 yard seasons with 195 receptions over the 2 years. Fixed drop issue in 2022 only dropping 3% of his targets. Top tier ball skills, can rise up over defenders to make a play. Good athlete, has great speed and can make plays with the ball in his hands.
cons: 5’10 175, a very small build for a receiver. Not the quick and twitch elite level you want for a guy his size. Almost exclusively worked from the slot.
take: Downs is going to be helped out by how well Jahan Dotson played in 2022. They have similar skill sets with solid hands good speed and being undersized. He should be able to step into a teams slot receiver role and play immediately.
WR Zay Flowers Boston College 79
info: 78 receptions 1,077 yards 12 TDs.
pros: Put up 3,000 career yards and 29 TDs. Makes some nice plays on the ball down the field, can adjust well. Shifty and fast, with space he can be electric.
cons: 5’10 170, he’s a very small receiver. Drops are an issue at 10.8% career drop rate. Haven’t seen him beat press too much, may be a slot only.
take: Flowers is another small explosive receiver that has good athleticism but the size may limit him. He’s very good with the ball in his hands and can make plays down the field so that should make him a viable receiver in the NFL. Its to be determined if he has the ability to translate to the NFL but with his athleticism its worth a shot.
WR Rashee Rice SMU 77
info: 96 receptions 1,344 yards 10 TDs.
pros: 6’3 205, has a good build for the position. Amazing at adjusting to the ball mid air and winning 50/50. Good speed for his size, can run away from defenders. Good with the ball in his hands, can make defenders miss easily. Was the number one guy his final year and got better every year.
cons: Played at SMU so not the best competition he went against. Didn’t see many advanced routes or technique, usually won on simple go’s or hitches and him being more physical.
take: Rice developed into a star for SMU in 2022, doubling his production from the previous year. He played against weaker competition that you would have liked to see but he’s such a physically gifted receiver that he will not be out of place in the NFL. If he can continue to progress he will be a star in the NFL.
WR Michael Wilson Stanford 77
info: 27 receptions 421 yards 4 TD 72 RECV.
pros: Good size at 6’2 216 and 9 7/8 inch hands. 62% contested catch rate, has good body control and hands. Good routes and releases, uses tempo well as well as physical ability to separate. Can add value after the catch with is size and athleticism.
cons: Extensive injury history, missed time nearly every year. Played 5 years and never had a great PFF grade.
take: Wilson only has 2 negatives and neither have to do with his ability. He wasn’t very productive and he has some big time injury concerns. Other than that he has the size, ball skills and athleticism as well as route running ability to play in the league. He should step in and immediately be a starting NFL receiver.
WR Marvin Mims Oklahoma 77
info: 54 receptions 1,082 yards 6 TDs.
pros: 19.5 Yards per catch, he’s a solid deep threat. 89 PFF receiving grade as a true freshman. Good athlete, very fluid in space and can punt return. Good with the ball, slippery to tackle, guys slide right off him even at 185. Great ball skills, made some unreal catches. True junior that produced every year at OK.
cons: 5’11 184, would like to see him add size. Played in a system where there is nothing but space to deal with, which is where he excels.
take: Mims was a stud recruit breaking Texas state records in high school and immediately made an impact in college. He has the athleticism and ball skills that are going to translate to the next level. He’s on the smaller side though which may limit him as a number 2 option, but he has the ability to be a good NFL WR.
WR Jonathan Mingo Ole Miss 77
info: 51 receptions 861 yards 5 TD 77.7 RECV.
pros: Very good size, 6’1 226 and 32 inch arms with 10 inch hands. Good athlete, his acceleration and agility are good. Good strength and run after the catch.
cons: Hands are average at best, 10.3 career drop percentage and 43.9% contested catch. Not a good route runner, doesn’t create separation by himself.
take: Mingo is a raw receiver with great upside. The physical part of the position he has down, he’s big fast and strong. He’s lacking the technical parts of the position though, his hands are all right and his routes are not good. The Ole Miss offense didn’t give him a shot to show it off but if he develops his game he can be a steal.
WR Nathaniel Dell Houston 76
info: 108 receptions 1,399 yards 17 TDs.
pros: Back-to-back 1,300 yard receiving seasons with 30 TDs. Amazing athlete, has the agility and speed you need to play at 165. Great deep threat with the ability to shake defenders deep and be wide open.
cons: Drops the ball more than you would like at 9%. 5’10 165, he’s a very small receiver. Played against lower level of competition than you would like.
take: Dell is Zay flowers but older and played at Houston. He’s way undersized but he’s such a great athlete he made up for it. He can be a teams return man as well as maybe develop into a deep threat out of the slot.
WR Jalin Hyatt Tennessee 76
info: Hyatt was a 4 star recruit out of Dutch Fork HS in SC where he led his team to back to back undefeated seasons while breaking his HS's receiving records .He initially committed to play of the Hokies before flipping his commitment to Tennessee. His Freshman year he got on start and had some use getting 276 receiving yards and 2 TDs. his sophomore year was more of the same but really broke out in 2022 and developed a great connection with Hendon Hooker. In 2022 he won the Biletnikoff and was named to the 1st team All SEC team after racking up 1,267 yards and 15 TDs.
pros: Accolades his senior year where as good as it gets. Great speed, can put on the burners and pull away from people. Solid hands, not just a speed guy who can't catch, he can catch through contact.
cons: One year of being a full time starter. Mostly a slot receiver in college, 87% of his snaps from there. Only got a 77 PFF grade, not whatyou expect from the Biletnikoff winner. Very thin frame, needs to add some size for NFL physicality. Awful out of the break and off the line, not quick just fast.
take: Hyatt can run fast, that's about where the positives end. He's not a polished receiver, he's not good out of breaks and doesn't do well with physicality. His top end outcome is a deep threat only.
WR Charlie Jones Purdue 76
info: 110 receptions 1,361 yards 12 TD 83.8 RECV.
pros: Had a great breakout 2022 season. Has been a top dog on his team, over 100 receptions. Doesn’t drop the ball, 3.9% drop rate. Smart player that knows where the open part of zones are and how to create separation. Great with the ball in the air, can track it and make the play.
cons: 6 foot 188, he’s on the thin side of the position. 1 good year in 5 seasons. Not great with the ball in his hands breaking tackles, not a great athlete.
take: Jones put on a show his final year of college, he was Purdues number 1. He only played well one year but everything he does translates to the league well. He’s got great ball skills and does a good job running his routes which is a good recipe in the league. He isn’t the top tier athlete that you want but he could end up being a great NFL player because his strengths are what you need in the NFL.
WR Cedric Tillman Tennessee 76
info: 37 receptions 417 yards 3 TDs.
pros: Good size, 6’3 215. Good hands and good catch radius, 5% career drop rate. Good body control and making plays on the ball through contact. Good physicality, uses hands well to create separation and run through contact.
cons: Injured for his final season for 6 weeks causing production to drop off. 1 out of 5 years he caught more than 40 balls. Not a good athlete, not quick and the speed is average. A lot of null plays in Tennessee offense where he doesn’t have to do anything.
take: Tillman had a great 4th season where he had over 1,000 yards after a down first 3 years. He came back for his 5th and final year to add on to his production but he got hurt. He’s a big bodied receiver that can make a play on the ball no matter who’s on him but he’s not that good athlete that will create separation.
WR Jayden Reed Michigan St 75
info: Reed was not a very coveted recruit out of Naperville IL where he was an All-Illinois first team receiver. He went to Western Michigan where he was a FWAA Freshman All American before transferring to Michigan St to play in the power 5. In 2021 he really broke out, as well as being the team’s best return man he also had 1000 yards receiving and 10 TDs. His senior year was a bit of a step back but he still had a 70 PFF grade with 636 yards and 5 TDs.
pros: Great athlete, moves different than most other receivers. Has the speed to take the top off the defense. Can create separation with his suddenness. Can return play a lot or outside receiver. Solid ability to rise up and make contested catches.
cons: Drop off in 2022 going from 82 to 71 grade. 5’10 190, he’s a smaller WR. Dances a little too much when he catches it. Hands are only average, his catch radius is ok because he’s not great at catching the ball away from his body.
take: Reed was a star receiver for Michigan State, he was a versatile receiver with returning ability for them. He is a good athlete that can get open with his speed and agility. He’s not the biggest receiver though and he doesn’t have the best hands which will limit him from going really early in the draft. He can step in and make an impact on an NFL roster now.
WR Xavier Hutchinson Iowa St 75
info: 107 receptions 1,171 yards 6 TDs
pros: good production catching over 100 balls in 2022 with an 89.4 receiving grade. Good hands, only a 4.9% career drop rate. Good routes/releases, can get off press and create separation initially. Long limbed, 6’3 and can extend to make plays on the ball. Great ball skills, does a great job reacting to the throw and getting in position to make a catch.
cons: Not very fast, isn’t threatening the defense vertically. Not quick out of breaks, he wont shake any DBs and break away from them.
take: Hutchinson was a big part of Iowa States offense, when they needed a 1st down he was their guy. He is a reliable big framed receiver that can make plays on the ball. He’s lacking that next gear though, he wont run past anyone or make anyone fear his athleticism.
WR Tyler Scott Cincinnati 75
info: 55 receptions 904 yards 9 TD 73.1 RECV.
pros: True junior that is an elite athlete. Great deep threat, deep routes are very good. He has great acceleration speed and agility.
cons: Small receiver at 5’11 185. Hands are only ok, he wont be making any great catches over anyone. Not a strong receiver, will struggle with physicality.
take: Scott is a smaller receiver but he is a top tier athlete that will scare defenses. He’s not going to become your top WR that take over games but he’s so fast he’s a threat to score every play.
WR Puka Nacua BYU 74
info: 48 receptions 625 yards 5 TD 90.1 RECV.
pros: Solid size, 6’1 205. 2 striaght good years of PFF grades and finishing with a 90.1 RECV. Solid contested catch rate at 61.8%. Played snaps at RB, has RAC ability. Good at the top of routes at subtly getting separation to make a play on the ball. Solid athlete, can hit home runs after the catch. Tough competitive kid.
cons: Not good at getting off press at the line. The suddenness in routes isn’t there, he wont be a top level route runner.
take: Nacua wont be the shifty route runner that will show the QB a wide open target, but that is not his game. He’s a great RAC receiver that has good ball skills and physicality to make a play on the ball. He should step in and immediately contribute for whatever team drafts him and could possibly become a force in the league.
WR Parker Washington Penn St 74
info: 46 receptions 611 yards 2 TDs.
pros: Stocky build at 5’10 215 and a true junior. Best hands I've seen, 5% drop and a surprisingly high contested catch rate. Unreal ball skills, can catch a ball in any position and can catch away from his body. Can add YAC with his center of gravity and strong lower half.
cons: Never really was the alpha in the receiving core, best season came with Jahan Dotson as the number 1. Not that fast and shifty for the play style that would fit his build. Doesn’t create the separation with his routes that you would like from a 5’10 slot guy.
take: Washington is an interesting eval, he’s got a weird stocky build for the position and isn’t that top end athlete. But, he’s very good with the ball in his hands and can go pluck the ball out of the air if it’s within his range. He will be able to step in as a return man and if he gets craftier with his routes he could be a great slot.
WR Kayshon Boutte LSU 74
info: Boutte was a 5 star recruit out of New Iberia LA where he was an All State receiver and a highly sought after recruit. He chose to stay home and go to the National Champion LSU tigers, he was immediately thought of as their number 1 but he always seemed to fall short of the very high expectations. His career highs were 48 receptions, 735 yards and 9 TDs which are solid but not top WR numbers. His career came to an end in a very interesting end when he said he would return but some off field issues arose and he declared.
pros: 5 star recruit and a true junior. Solid build at 6 foot 200 and has good speed to go along with it.
cons: Has some off field concerns at LSU. Has drop issues, at 11% drop rate. Hate his effort on routes, he doesn’t work to get open and he’s lazy.
take: Boutte is a case of all the talent in the world but non of the effort. It makes me upset to watch such a physically talented WR play the way he does.
WR Rakim Jarrett Maryland 74
info: 40 receptions 471 yards 3 TD 62.3 RECV.
pros: Former 5 star recruit that is a true junior. Stayed loyal to Maryland over leaving for a big time program. Good athlete, has speed and agility so the potential is good.
cons: Never took over like a 5 star should at Maryland. 11.8% drop rate and 18.2% contested catch rate, scary numbers for his hands. Didn’t run a real good route his entire career, he was limited and didn’t run good routes. Looks like he doesn’t try on plays, jogs routes too much.
take: Jarrett has been a definite disappointment for Maryland. He was a high 5 star recruit and he never made a huge impact or justified that 5 star ranking. He’s a great athlete but his tape is meh, he hasn’t developed any receiver ability past HS it seems.
WR David Durden West Florida 74
info: 34 receptions 787 yars 10 TD. 6’1 204 with 30 3/8 arms and 9 ½ hands.
pros: Had a solid pro day, at 204 he ran a 4.46 jumped 37 inches and had a 4.21 shuttle and a 7 3 cone. Student of the game. Good game speed, can stack and create separation. Great movement skills, can change directions at a high level. Runs very nice routes.
cons: Transferred away from mercer to play at Western Carolina, not a high level. Ran mostly in the slot in college. Older prospect that is an unknown.
take: NA
WR AT Perry Wake Forest 73
info: 71 receptions 1,296 yards 15 TD 83 RECV.
pros: Great length, 6’3 195 with 33.75 inch arms. Back to back 1000 yard receiving seasons with 83 RECV grades. Good catch radius with his length and vertical. Comes back to attack the ball well. Solid release package, uses hands and shake well.
cons: Only average hands, 10% drop rate and a sub 50% contested catch. Sub par athlete, his agility isn’t very good. His routes need work, Wakes offense didn’t have him do much.
take: Perry is the prototypical X receiver, he’s a long receiver that can win on the sideline whether that be tracking the ball or coming back to it on a comeback. He was ultra productive and showed solid ball skills but he’s not a complete prospect. The athleticism is just ok and he dropped too many balls over the course of the year. He may be able to step in at X day 1 but I wouldn’t expect him to take over the league.
WR Justin Shorter Florida 73
info: 29 receptions 577 yards 2 TD 75.2 RECV.
pros: 6’4 224, great size. 5 star recruit, was the top receiver over Amon Ra, Jmar Chase and Jaylen Waddle. 20 YPC, he can be a big play threat. Good hands, career 5% drop and 0 drops in 2022. Was open all the time in the Tennessee game. Good ability to stack the receiver, can run past guys and track the ball.
cons: Former 5 star that has been a disappointment. Has struggled with his health and his weight, possibly eat his way to a TE. Didn’t force a missed tackle in 2022. Doesn’t have much quickness to his game, not going to shake DBs. Mediocre routes, needs to be a bit more savvy and find space. Doesn’t have the most natural hands, it gets tough when he has to extend away from his body.
take: Shorter had a disappointing college career but I have hope for his NFL career. He’s an elite size and athleticism combo that has flashed some great play over the last 3 years at Florida. If he can dedicate himself to learning the receiver position at the NFL level he could be a star.
WR Trey Palmer Nebraska 73
info: Palmer was a 4 star recruit coming out of Kentwood LA where he was a track star winning a state title with a 21.11 200 meter time. Palmer Didn't play much in his first 3 years at LSU so he transferred to Nebraska to be their number 1 guy. He was in fact, he caught 71 balls for 1043 yards and 9 TDs with an 83 grade and was named 2nd team all big 10.
pros: 1,000 yards in his one year as a featured guy. Elite speed, he’s a true deep threat.
cons: 6 foot 190, he’s on the small side. Hands are questionable, 13% drop rate and 39% contested catch rate. Not an explosive athlete, burst and agility are mediocre.
take: Palmer is a one trick pony, he’s a burner. His entire game is his elite speed. He will not be anything more than a deep threat though which doesn’t work in the NFL.
WR Bryce Ford-Wheaton West Virginia 73
info: 62 receptions 675 yards 7 TD 70.3 RECV.
pros: Great size, 6’3 222 with 33.5 inch arms. Strong, can fight through contact and make a catch through contact. Freaky testing numbers at the combine.
cons: Not great with the ball in his hands, doesn’t offer much RAC. Doesn’t run good routes, rounds them and doesn’t accelerate.
take: After a blazing hot start to the season with 20 receptions and 250 yards and 4 TD through 2 weeks Ford-Wheaton cooled off from there. He’s a big bodied receiver that can be a good red zone threat for a team.
WR Jake Bobo UCLA 72
info: 54 receptions 789 yards 7 TD 83.7 RECV.
pros: 6’4 215, he has great size. Very good hands, 5% career drop rate. Great feel for finding space in zone. Uses hands well to gain separation. Good body control, can catch a ball in any position.
cons: Not a great athlete, won’t be much of a deep threat. Not explosive with the ball in his hands, RAC is not a strong suit. 5th year player that had one good year.
take: Bobo is a very solid and steady receiver, he has amazing hands and good knowledge of how to get open. He’s a reliable big bodied receiver that is a QBs safety blanket. He’s not a big time threat to score every play though, with average athleticism he’s not a burner or a big time RAC threat.
WR CJ Johnson East Carolina 72
info: 60 receptions 933 yards 9 TD 76.5 RECV.
pros: Good size, 6’2 220. 3% drop rate in the last 2 years, good hands. Strong receiver, can run through contact and run after the catch. He’s a dog, will fight for yards. He can play the ball very well.
cons: Played for east Carolina, low level competition. Played a lot of slot and not many reps in press, it will be an adjustment.
take: Johnson was unstoppable for East Carolina, he’s a big strong receiver that can make plays. He’s not the best athlete but his game is physicality, he can attack the ball and run through contact. He should be a good depth piece initially and possibly develop into a good starter soon.
WR Jadon Haselwood Arkansas 72
info: Haselwood didn't have a hard time getting offers out of Fayetteville AR, he was the top WR prospect and a high 5 star. He committed to the power house OU where he played with QBs Jalen Hurts, Spencer Rattler and Caleb Williams. He never produced much at Oklahoma, he only had 650 total yards in 3 years and looked like a bust of a 5 star. He left OU when Lincoln Riley left and went back to his home state of Arkansas where he had 59 receptions for 700 yards and 3 TDs after recovering from an ACL tear in 2020.
pros: Good size at 6’2 213, ideal outside receiver. Natural hands catcher, attacks the ball and catches away from the body. Can really run after the catch, he’s a strong runner with a good feel for space. Physical receiver, can play through contact and use hands in routes well.
cons: Never got the play time and targets at Oklahoma a 5 star recruit should get. A lot of lazy routes where he’s drifting and that was a part of the offense. Not a sudden athlete, won’t be shaking any defenders and creating separation. Top speed isn’t great, he won’t threaten defensive backs deep. Total career production would be good for one year, it’s concerning he never could get more targets.
take: Haselwood was a top tier prospect and had high hopes when he went to Oklahoma as a freshman. His career didn’t go how he would like it though, never getting the targets he would want. He did show that he is a big physical receiver with good ball skills though which is perfect for an X receiver. He could get a chance to start at some point because of the size and physicality.
WR Joseph Ngata Clemson 72
info: 41 receptions 526 yards 2 TD 67.1 RECV.
pros: Great size at 6’2 220. Very good recruit that played immediately. Good ball skills, can catch away from his frame well. Strong, can run routes through contact and make run with the ball.
cons: Production was middling, never got over 550 yards. Missed a lit of games do to injury. His route running is average, needs to continue to work on finding space.
take: Ngata is a pretty good blend of size and athleticism but was held back by injury. He has plenty of upside with his ball skills and physical attributes but still needs to develop his routes. He should be taken to develop and hopefully become a good X receiver.
WR Demario Douglas Liberty 72
info: 70 receptions 980 yards 6 TD 86.2 RECV
pros: Was liberties top target and graded well. 5% drop rate, good hands. Unreal change of direction ability and feel to make people miss.
cons: 5’8 175, he’s very small. Not great at making plays away from his body, his catch radius is small. A lot of not real routes ran.
take: Douglas is this years Kadarius Toney. He’s much smaller and doesn’t have the receiving ability of an NFL receiver but he’s electric with the ball and moves so well. He at the least can return for a team and if he develops can be a dangerous WR.
WR Andrei Iosivas Princeton 72
info: 64 receptions 924 yards 7 TD 85.7 RECV.
pros: Good size, 6’3 212. Dominated low level competition. Solid hands, 4.5% drop rate in 2022. Looks like a good athlete against bad competition.
cons: 8.5 inch hands. He doesn’t have the most natural hands, catches on the body. He played against garbage FCS teams.
take: Iosivas has the look of an NFL receiver but he’s such a projection because of the competition he played against. Get him on a team and let him develop while he can contribute on special teams.
WR Dontay Demus Maryland 72
info: 22 receptions 233 yards 1 TD 56 RECV.
pros: Good size, 6’3 210. Was dominating in 2021 until he got hurt. Good speed to go with his size, he’s a deep threat. Good strength to get through defenders.
cons: Only 233 yards in his 5th year. Tore his ACL in 2021 and didn’t look the same after. Not a quick athlete, routes wouldn’t be called crisp.
take: Demus was a great prospect through week 5 of 2021. Unfortunately he tore his ACL after a blazing hot start. If he can get back to the 2021 form he can be a starting NFL receiver.
WR Grant DuBose Charlotte 71
info: 63 receptions 793 yards 9 TD 72.8 RECV.
pros: 6’2 205, he’s got solid size. Back to back solid seasons of 60+ and 750+. Good route runner, he’s very good out of the top of his break. Good release, can shake guys at the line.
cons: Played at Charlotte, not the best competition. Athleticism is not good, he can’t threaten deep.
take: Dubose is a very solid receiver that has played well for Charlotte. He’s such a good route runner, from the release to the stem of the route he is great. His issue is that he isn’t the level of athlete you would like to see. He could become a starting receiver but he needs to win without his athleticism.
WR Elijah Higgins Stanford 71
info: 59 receptions 704 yards 2 TD 64.8 RECV.
pros: Great size at 6’3 228 with 32 inch arms and 10.5 inch hands. Got more production every single year. Some of the best speed and acceleration at the senior bowl.
cons: Never dominated, his best year was 704 yards. For a guy his size he is only ok at contested catches, 43%. Not a sudden player, agility isn’t the best which hurts his routes. Not great off press which will throw off timing.
take: Higgins has the ideal size and speed a team is looking for, he is 6’3 230 and has good speed. He’s a developmental receiver though, his releases and routes are not there yet and his production doesn’t match someone that physically gifted. He should be a depth piece that can play special teams and if he develops he can be a great outside receiver.
WR Matt Landers Arkansas 71
info: 44 receptions 780 yards 7 TD 71.4 RECV.
pros: 6’4 200, good size and length. Surprising twitch for a guy his size, can shake guys. Good with the ball in his hands, he can make people miss.
cons: One year of producing after leaving Georgia. Not a great route runner, doesn’t set guys up well. Not a strong receiver, wont play through contact and make catches well.
take: Landers is a rare blend of length and agility. He isn’t the best route runner and his ball skills are average which isn’t ideal. Since you can’t teach that size and agility he should get a late round flyer to see if he can develop.
WR Dontayvion Wicks Virginia 70
info: 57 receptions 1,201 yards 9 TD 80.4 RECV.
pros: Good size at 6’2 212 and 32.75 inch arms and 10 inch hands. Had a 1,201 yard season in 2022 before the offense became a dumpster fire. Good patience in his releases. Good stop ability, can stop on a dime. Good underneath receiver, can run nice routes and find open holes in the zone.
cons: Massive drop off in 2022, 800 less receiving yards. Hands are a massive question, 23% drop rate in 2022. Not a high level athlete.
take: It may have just been the 2022 Virginia offense, but that year was terrible. He has an amazing 2021 season followed by the biggest disappointment in 2022. If he can return to pre 2022 form he will be a great value pick.
WR Ronnie Bell Michigan 70
info: Bell was an under recruited player out of Park Hill in Kansas City. He got an offer from Michigan and he jumped on it and it worked out for both sides. He appeared in 13 games as a true freshman and got 10 starts his sophomore year while being named Michigan’s Offensive Skill POY. his senior year was looking to be a big one after returning a punt 31 yards and scoring a 76 yard TD, unfortunately he tore his ACL in that game and it ended that season. He came back in 2021 and was named a team captain and caught 50 yards for 686 yards and 2 TDs.
pros: Played in both the slot and out wide. Michigan’s number 1 receiver. Solid routes, does some subtle things to get a bit of separation. NFL athlete, has the quickness and speed to be an NFL receiver.
cons: Awful contested catch rate at a career 20%. Torn ACL in 2021. Not the biggest receiver at 5’11 192. Didn’t see many press reps, may struggle with physicality. No trump card, doesn’t have great speed, strength or routes/production.
take: Bell is a very solid receiver, he was Michigans number one guy thanks to his solid overall ability. He runs solid routes and has the athleticism to add to the run after the catch. It’s tough to only see one top year of production and not be the ideal size though, he should be a good depth piece for a WR core.
WR Michael Jefferson Louisiana 70
info: 51 receptions 810 yards 7 TD 76.8 RECV.
pros: 6’4 202, he’s a tall receiver. Surprisingly quick for his size, has a nice release off the line. Good speed, can run past safeties. Was open a lot but his QB couldn’t hit him.
cons: Didn’t play in the power 5. Mostly a vertical player, not great underneath. Not very strong, he’s a little thin.
take: Jefferson is a really good receiver that played at a lower level of competition. He’s a real deep threat with his size and speed to threaten the defense. He should make a roster as a good back up and if he adds some strength he could end up being a great player.
WR Keylon Stokes Tulsa 70
info: 76 receptions 1,224 yards 8 TD 80.9 RECV.
pros: 2 1,000 yard season. Team captain. Good athlete, can get in and out of routes well.
cons: Played 6 years and was inconsistent. 5’10 198 he’s on the smaller side. 11% career drop percentage, too many drops. No catch radius. Slot only.
take: Stokes has a very good slot build, he’s a solid athlete with a stockier build so he can handle physicality. He played in a wide open offense in college so it will be different for him so he will need to run better routes and catch the ball better. He could end up being a nice slot option for a team.
WR Malik Heath Ole Miss 70
info: 52 receptions 834 yards 4 TD 74.1 RECV.
pros: Good size, 6’2 215. Good speed, can stack defenders vertically. Good body control, can work back to the ball.
cons: Only a vertical threat, ran hitches and go’s. One year of production.
take: Heaths size is a bit deceiving, he’s not a strong physical RAC receiver. He’s a vertical athlete that plays on the outside only right now. He has the traits to be good so he just needs to work on the rest of his game.
WR Jaray Jenkins LSU 70
info: 24 receptions 332 yards 5 TD 64.6 RECV.
pros: 6’1 200, solid size. Said to be a good locker room guy. Good ball skills, seems to stick to his hands. Good releases, can accelerate out of it.
cons: Never produced that much, his full career is a good year. Not a good athlete, he’s a very average athlete.
take: Jenkins never put up big numbers but he’s such a solid receiver. He plays the position like a pro, his releases are nice, he can catch everything and is a good locker room guy. His upside may not be the highest but he’s a good receiver.
WR Jalen Cropper Fresno St 70
info: 83 receptions 1,089 yards 5 TD 75 RECV.
pros: Back to back 80+ reception seasons. Solid drop rate, 6% in 2022. Good hands and body control. Good quickness, can stop and start very well.
cons: 5’11 171 with 29.75 inch arms and 8.5 inch hands, he’s a small receiver. Not a top end athlete like is needed for 171 pounds.
take: Cropper was a very good and productive receiver over the last two seasons. He has the ball skills and body control along with quickness to have a shot at being an NFL receiver. The issue is he’s 170 pounds and not overly athletic which would be needed at that size.
WR Trea Shopshire UAB 69
info: 41 receptions 923 yards 6 TD 83.4 RECV.
pros: Improved each year and finished his career with a good season. Good in contested catch situations. Averaged a career 23 YPC. 6’3, he’s got good length. Burner, so fast.
cons: 195 pounds, he’s a slim receiver that struggles with physicality. Played at UAB against lower level competition. Not a good route runner, no suddenness.
take: Shopshire may run a 4.3, his strides are so long and he stretches a defense so much with his speed height and contested catch ability. He’s a deep threat only so he won’t become a number one ever, but if you want somone to run straight he is your guy.
WR Jason Brownlee Southern Miss 69
info: 52 receptions 819 yards 7 TD 77.3 RECV.
pros: Good size at 6’2 202. 5% drop rate, pretty good hands. Good body control and ball skills. Solid route runner, gets off the line well and does subtle things to stack and separate.
cons: Played at Southern Miss. Not a good athlete, the speed is alright and break out of his routes are ok.
take: Brownlee wont impress anyone physically. He is a long smooth athlete that can run nice routes and make a play on the ball. He should be able to add depth to a receiving core.
WR Elijah Cooks San Jose St 69
info: 70 receptions 1,086 yards 10 TD 83.6 RECV.
pros: Had 2 900+ yards seasons with a great 2022 season. Good contested catch guy, he has good ball skills and body control. 6’3 210 good size.
cons: Old prospect, has been playing since 2017. Not the best athlete, isn’t very quick.
take: Cooks was playing against some low level competition but he dominated them. In 2022 he showed off his contested catch ability and his excellent body control. The ability to make a play on the ball will be his calling card, if he can add some strength and continue making plays he will make it in the league.
WR Jalen Wayne South Alabama 69
info: 57 receptions 812 yards 9 TD 69.5 RECV.
pros: Good size, 6’1 211. Solid straight speed, can win down the field.
cons: 6th year player that had 1.5 solid seasons. Not much of an underneath receiver, he doesn’t have suddenness or good routes.
take: Wayne is a good sized athlete that threatens down the field. He became a full time WR later in college and it shows because his routes underneath need work. If he develops in practice at the NFL he could be a nice piece for a teams receiving core.
WR Mitchell Tinsley Penn St 69
info: 51 receptions 577 yards 5 TD 67.2 RECV.
pros: Dominated at western Kentucky, 1,400 yards. 4.8 career drop rate, solid hands. Good route runner, know what to do on every route.
cons: He’s an Average athlete, wont run past defenders. Not a physical receiver, he doesn’t play through contact well.
take: Tinsley screams good NFL backup, he doesn’t have the best catch radius, athleticism and size but he’s a solid player. He’s got reliable hands and good routes which makes him a trustworthy receiver.
WR Sam James West Virginia 69
info: 46 receptions 745 yards 6 TD 67.5 RECV. 6’0 176.
pros: Solid athlete, has the speed and shake to play in the NFL. Lead the team in receiving, pretty good at getting open with routes.
cons: Super thin receiver, should add some weight. 11% drop rate, needs better hands. His stop routes take too long, doesn’t sink his hips well.
take: NA
WR Antoine Green North Carolina 68
info: 38 receptions 745 yards 7 TD 76.7 RECV.
pros: Solid size at 6’2 200. Averaged 20 YPC in back to back years. He was a track star, has good athleticism. Good ball skills, can make plays on the ball.
cons: Routes are not good, he doesn’t get in or out of breaks fast. Creates little to no separation by himself. No release package.
take: Green isn’t a good receiver, his size and athleticism is good enough for the NFL but he hasn’t shown much on film. He isn’t good with his routes or releases and didn’t show many high level plays where he’s getting open.
WR Tre Tucker Cincinnati 68
info: 53 attempts 680 yards 3 TD 69.5 RECV.
pros: Speed for days, one of the fastest players in the draft. Worked the middle of the field well. Great overall athleticism, can shake dudes and accelerate quickly. Good return man
cons: He’s very small, at 5’9 187 he has 28 inch arms and 8.5 inch hands. Never had a season over 700 yards. Was a slot only player in college. Not natural hands, catching doesn’t look easy.
take: Tucker is a great athlete and can really stretch the defense. He’s just so undersized and played slot only that the NFL will be a big adjustment. He can be a gadget player that can return for a team.
WR Derius Davis TCU 68
info: 42 receptions 531 yards 5 TD 66.4 RECV.
pros: Good run after the catch, broke a tackle on 25% of his receptions. Great return man and gadget player. May run a 4.2 he can fly.
cons: 5’8 168 with 7.5 inch hands, he’s as small as it gets. Not an actual receiver.
take: Would you draft a return man only that can be a gadget player. If you would Davis is your guy, he’s a great athlete but so small that he’s not going to be a receiver.
WR Isaiah Winstead East Carolina 68
info: 88 receptions 1,085 yards 6 TD.
pros: 6’3 210, good size. 3% drop rate in 2022. Good hands, can make plays on the ball.
cons: One good year. Not a good athlete, speed and agility below average. Routes are not crisp.
take: Winstead was a productive receiver on a great east Carolina team. He has the size and ball skills to get a shot in the league, but his athleticism and routes aren’t where they need to be.
WR Zakhari Franklin UTSA 68
info: 93 receptions 1,128 yards 15 TD 77.7 RECV.
pros: Over 1000 yards back to back seasons. 5.8% career drop percentage, good hands.
cons: Slender build, 6’1 185. Doesn’t have much strength, will struggle with physicality. Rounds his routes.
take: Franklin is a slim framed not overly athletic receiver that was somehow very productive. He clearly is doing something right but it will be tough to translate to the NFL.
WR Nikko Remigio Fresno St 68
info: 64 receptions 700 yards 5 TD 77.8 RECV.
pros: Broke out at fresno state, solid year. 3% drop rate in 2022, good hands. Good agility, can cut and accelerate well.
cons: 5’9 183, he’s a small receiver. One good year over 5. Not a real receiver, he’s a guy you manufacture space for currently.
take: I’m not going to lie, I’ve watched 7 straight sub 5’10 185 guys and they all blend in. He’s quick and has good hands and can return so he could be useful for a team. He just is small and needed to play in space vs playing actual receiver.
WR Shaq Davis South Carolina St 68
info: 44 receptions 944 yards 11 TD 70.8 RECV.
pros: Amazing size, 6’5 217 with 34 inch arms. Great catch radius, he’s so long and can extend.
cons: Played against low level competition. MASSIVE DROP ISSUES, he loves to catch with his body and has a 20% drop rate. Not a good athlete, he doesn’t separate.
take: Davis was a top receiver in the FCS using his great size to dominate lesser competition. That’s his strengths though, he can’t catch well and isn’t a good athlete so it’s a tough sell for the NFL.
WR Keytaon Thompson Virginia 68
info: 53 receptions 579 yards 0 TD 72.9 RECV.
pros: Great size, 6’5 216. Former 4-star QB that could throw doe a team. Broke out in 2021 with 990 yards.
cons: Not a defined position, was more playmaker than any position. Dropped off in 2022 because the Virginia offense sucked. Doesn’t have the most natural hands, 12% drop rate. Weird strides, doesn’t eat up much ground.
take: Thompson is a very unique player, he was very productive but I’m not sure how. He runs very weird and isn’t that good of an athlete, but he is smart and knows how to find space. I like him but I don’t think he will make it.
WR Jacob Copeland Maryland 68
info: 26 receptions 376 yards 2 TD 71.3 RECV.
pros: Good athlete, has the speed and quickness that you want in a receiver.
cons: Didn’t start and didn’t get over 40 receptions in 5 years. Not a good route runner or good off the line.
take: Copeland is a pretty good athlete that was a disappointment in college. He never became that guy because his actual receiver skills never developed, like getting off press or running routes but the potential is there.
WR Kearis Jackson Georgia 68
info: 18 receptions 243 yards 0 TD 71 RECV.
pros: 6 foot 200 and a solid athlete. Not many drops.
cons: Barely used, over 5 years 69 receptions 963 yards 4 TD.
take: Jackson is a complete project, he didn’t actually start his entire career. He’s a solid athlete with solid size but he had 18 reception in 2022.
WR Jared Wayne Pitt 68
info: 60 receptions 1,062 yards 5 TD 82.2 RECV.
pros: 6’3 208, good size. Improved every year, became a featured part of the offense in 2022. Solid hands, good and reliable hands. Made plays without top tier traits, could be a guy that always surprises.
cons: Not a good athlete, the speed will not threaten anyone. Routes wont create much separation, his releases are ok and he doesn’t get out of his breaks well.
take: Wayne is a reliable solid receiver that flashes good routes. His hands are good and he’s a steady player but his athleticism will hinder him heavily. He should be signed to see if he can make it work as a good depth piece but its an uphill battle.
WR Josh Vann South Carolina 68
info: 18 receptions 296 yards 3 TD 63 RECV. 5’11 192 with 31 3/8 arms.
pros: Smooth route runner, solid out of the break and can bend his routes well.
cons: Was not a teams starter. Not a high end athlete, speed and quickness are middle of the pack.
take: NA
WR Jadakis Bonds Hampton 67
info: 51 receptions 863 yards 10 TD.
pros: Good size at 6’3 205. Was a solid deep threat, good at tracking the ball.
cons: Played at Hampton. 12% drop rate, his hands aren’t that good. Probably not a good athlete, only looked good at the FBS level.
take: Bonds is a good sized receiver with 3 solid years at Hampton. He’s very good at tracking the ball over his shoulder and dominated lesser competition. He is in for a big adjustment in the NFL though, his routes are at an FCS level and his hands are questionable which is not a good combo.
WR Kazmeir Allen UCLA 67
info: 49 receptions 400 yards 2 TD 72.9 RECV.
pros: 4 career drops, his hands aren’t bad. Pretty good athlete, has some speed and change of direction ability.
cons: 5’8 176 and 29 inch arms, he’s small. No catch radius, need to put it on him. Purely a gimic player.
take: Allen is a playmaker only, he can make guys miss in space and out run people. He just isn’t a receiver so he wont be useful to a receiving core.
WR Jalen Brooks South Carolina 67
info: 33 receptions 499 yards 1 TD 62.4 RECV.
pros: Solid size at 6’1 205. Fixed his drop rate from 2020.
cons: Never really produced, only 499 receiving yards in 2022. Not a great athlete, not shake or great speed to his game. Routes are ok, nothing special.
take: Brooks is an ok WR, he’s definitely not special though. He isn’t a plus athlete, route runner or have plus ball skills. He may get a chance in the league but he probably wont make a roster.
WR Malik Knowles Kansas St 67
info: 46 receptions 675 yards 2 TD 73.1 RECV.
pros: Solid size, 6’2 200. 1 drop in 2022. Smooth player that adjust to the ball well.
cons: Didn’t produce that much, max 675 in a season. Takes a long time to stop. Not a good athlete, speed is average.
take: Knowles is a long receiver with solid ability to make a play on the ball. He’s just not a good athlete, no twitch and average speed so his separation is not good.
WR Kris Thorton James Madison 67
info: 60 receptions 1,011 yards 7 TD 86.5 RECV.
pros: Back to back 1,000 yard seasons. Good speed and reliable hands. Will cant through contact.
cons: Played against low level competition. 5’8 180, very small. Slot only, can’t play on the outside.
take: Thorton is a productive slot that had 2 very good seasons to end his college career. He’s got the speed and hands but he’s small and not dynamic with the ball. To be that size and make it in the league he needs to be a playmaker.
WR Joshua Tomas Georgetown 67
info: 102 receptions 1,237 yards 11 TD 89.9 RECV.
pros: Good smooth athlete that runs good routes. 89.9 RECV grade, was very good for them.
cons: Small receiever, listed at 5’10 190 but smaller. Played against FCS. Slot only.
take: Tomas is a great FCS slot receiver but the NFL may be too big of a jump for him.
WR Duece Watts Tulane 67
info: 33 receptions 652 yards 8 TD 69.8 RECV. 6’2 200.
pros: 20 YPC, certified deep threat. Good build, has solid length.
cons: Hands are bad, drop problems. Not a route runner, no twitch to his game.
take: NA
WR Dallas Daniels Jackson St 66
info: 65 receptions 685 yards 6 TD 62.4 RECV.
pros: Forced 21 missed tackles on 65 receptions. Good with the ball in his hands, can make plays in space. Good quickness, can cut and stop on a dime.
cons: Small receiver at 5’10 176. Played against low level competition. Doesn’t actually run routes now, a lot of college routes. Not physical, wont be able to play through contact.
take: Daniels is a small athletic receiver with the ability to make a play when he gets the ball. He didn’t play against the top competition and wasn’t in a real offense so he is a major projection. He should make a training camp roster but that’s most likely it.
