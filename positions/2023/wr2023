WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba Ohio St 89
info: Smith-Njigba was a 5 star coming out of Rockwall HS in TX where he put up absurd numbers and leaving the state of Texas to join Olave and Wilson in Ohio at OSU. in 2020 his true freshman season he played sparingly thanks to 3 top 15 picks but Jameson Williams left for Alabama the next year and he stepped into the slot role. His 2021 season was great, he caught 95 balls for 1,600 yards and 9 TDs with a 91.7 pff grade. Nothing was more impressive than what he did when he was the lone target in their bowl game where he put up 336 yards and 3 TDs. He let down OSU his senior year after he got hurt and only played 40 total snaps in 2022 and missed the CFP.
pros: Didn't have many contested catch snaps but he went 9/10 when he got them. Really good and natural hands, makes tough catches look simple. Really good out of breaks, sets up defenders well and accelerates out of the break. Great body control, can twist and readjust to any ball to make the catch.
cons: Missed so many games in 2022, he only had one season of actually playing. Played slot only with stars on the outside, a very easy situation. Doesn't have the best speed, wont run away from anyone. Never really had to deal with press.
take: Smith-Njigba would be a top 10 pick easily if he repeated hos 2021 performance, but he missed his senior season. He's got the Keenan Allen skill of getting open and making plays on the ball but is just lacking that top end speed. The ability to be a great number 1 receiver is there, but with the lack of pysical tools it is more of a risk than you would like.
WR Jordan Addison USC 87
info: Addison was a slightly built 4 star recruit out of Frederick MD where he decided to stay closer to home and enroll at Pitt with future 1st round pick Kenny Pickett. He made an immediate impact by catching 60 balls for 662 yards and was named a True Freshman All American. His Sophomore season blew that out of the water though, he caught 100 balls for 1,593 yards a 17 TDs which was enough to win him the Biletnikoff award. That season made him a hot commodity in the transfer portal where he teamed up with Caleb Williams to lead USC to a comeback season for the Trojans. He caught 59 balls for 875 yards and 8 TDs and was named 1st team All-PAC 12.
pros: Production alone is great, 3,130 career yards and a Biletnikoff award. Good speed, can burn DBs down the field. Fixed drop concerns in 2022, only dropped 2 balls and made a lot of nice catches. Quick in his routes, with the ball and off the line. Good balance, can get knocked around and stay on his feet. Good ball skills down the field, can track the ball well.
cons: Slim frame, at 180 pounds he can get pushed around with physicality and mess up timing. Would have liked to see more production in 2022 with Caleb Williams.
take: Addison is pretty close to Garrett Wilson coming out, both are undersized but so quick and good at the position it didn’t derail them. He can clearly produce while being the teams number 1 and I expect that to continue in the NFL.
WR Rashee Rice SMU 82
info: 96 receptions 1,344 yards 10 TDs.
pros: 6’3 205, has a good build for the position. Amazing at adjusting to the ball mid air and winning 50/50. Good speed for his size, can run away from defenders. Good with the ball in his hands, can make defenders miss easily. Was the number one guy his final year and got better every year.
cons: Played at SMU so not the best competition he went against. Didn’t see many advanced routes or technique, usually won on simple go’s or hitches and him being more physical.
take: Rice developed into a star for SMU in 2022, doubling his production from the previous year. He played against weaker competition that you would have liked to see but he’s such a physically gifted receiver that he will not be out of place in the NFL. If he can continue to progress he will be a star in the NFL.
WR Josh Downs North Carolina 81
info: Downs was a 4 star recruit out of Suwanee GA where he was an All State player as well as a triple jump and long jump star. He committed to North Carolina to play with Sam Howell and learn behind Dyamni Brown. After Brown went to the NFL Downs stepped up and became the teams number 1 catching 101 balls for 1,335 yards and solidified himself as one of the nations top WRs. He came back in 2022 and caught 94 yards for 1,029 yards and 11 TDs which was good enough to be an All American.
pros: Back to back 1,000 yard seasons with 195 receptions over the 2 years. Fixed drop issue in 2022 only dropping 3% of his targets. Top tier ball skills, can rise up over defenders to make a play. Good athlete, has great speed and can make plays with the ball in his hands.
cons: 5’10 175, a very small build for a receiver. Not the quick and twitch elite level you want for a guy his size. Almost exclusively worked from the slot.
take: Downs is going to be helped out by how well Jahan Dotson played in 2022. They have similar skill sets with solid hands good speed and being undersized. He should be able to step into a teams slot receiver role and play immediately.
WR Quentin Johnston TCU 80
info: Johnston was a high 4 star recruit coming out of Temple HS in TX where he originally committed to Texas. He ultimately decided to go to TCU as one of the highest WR recruits they ever got. His first season there he showed off some impressive deep ball skills racking up 487 yards and 22.1 YPC. In 2021 as a true sophomore he showed his big play ability again with spectacular catches and 604 receiving yards. He really broke out in 2022 where he got 1,067 receiving yards and was named 1st team big 12 and lead TCU to the national championship game.
pros: Great size at 6’4 215 and is 21 as a true junior. He is a walking big play, averaged 18.8 YPC over his career. Great with the ball in his hands, he broke 19 tackles in 2022. Physical freak, can fly at his size, runs past CBs easily. Strong with the ball, can stick a foot in the ground and shake off defenders.
cons: May be the next Kevin White, game may not translate. For a guy his size he only was at a 40% career contested catch rate. Had a 10% drop rate which for a top receiver is a little high. Not impressive out of breaks, will not be creating separation at the stem. Agility and twitch are not apart of his game, he moves a little slow when trying to make people miss
take: null
WR Zay Flowers Boston College 76
info: 78 receptions 1,077 yards 12 TDs.
pros: Put up 3,000 career yards and 29 TDs. Makes some nice plays on the ball down the field, can adjust well. Shifty and fast, with space he can be electric.
cons: 5’10 170, he’s a very small receiver. Drops are an issue at 10.8% career drop rate. Haven’t seen him beat press too much, may be a slot only.
take: Flowers is another small explosive receiver that has good athleticism but the size may limit him. He’s very good with the ball in his hands and can make plays down the field so that should make him a viable receiver in the NFL. Its to be determined if he has the ability to translate to the NFL but with his athleticism its worth a shot.
WR Marvin Mims Oklahoma 77
info: 54 receptions 1,082 yards 6 TDs.
pros: 19.5 Yards per catch, he’s a solid deep threat. 89 PFF receiving grade as a true freshman. Good athlete, very fluid in space and can punt return. Good with the ball, slippery to tackle, guys slide right off him even at 185. Great ball skills, made some unreal catches. True junior that produced every year at OK.
cons: 5’11 184, would like to see him add size. Played in a OK system where there is nothing but space to deal with.
take: Mims was a stud recruit breaking Texas state records in high school and immediately made an impact in college. He has the athleticism and ball skills that are going to translate to the next level. He’s on the smaller side though which may limit him as a number 2 option, but he has the ability to be a good NFL WR.
WR Xavier Hutchinson Iowa St 76
info: 107 receptions 1,171 yards 6 TDs
pros: good production catching over 100 balls in 2022 with an 89.4 receiving grade. Good hands, only a 4.9% career drop rate. Good routes/releases, can get off press and create separation initially. Long limbed, 6’3 and can extend to make plays on the ball. Great ball skills, does a great job reacting to the throw and getting in position to make a catch.
cons: Not very fast, isn’t threatening the defense vertically. Not quick out of breaks, he wont shake any DBs and break away from them.
take: Hutchinson was a big part of Iowa States offense, when they needed a 1st down he was their guy. He is a reliable big framed receiver that can make plays on the ball. He’s lacking that next gear though, he wont run past anyone or make anyone fear his athleticism.
WR Kayshon Boutte LSU 74
info: Boutte was a 5 star recruit out of New Iberia LA where he was an All State receiver and a highly sought after recruit. He chose to stay home and go to the National Champion LSU tigers, he was immediately thought of as their number 1 but he always seemed to fall short of the very high expectations. His career highs were 48 receptions, 735 yards and 9 TDs which are solid but not top WR numbers. His career came to an end in a very interesting end when he said he would return but some off field issues arose and he declared.
pros: 5 star recruit and a true junior. Solid build at 6 foot 200 and has good speed to go along with it.
cons: Has some off field concerns at LSU. Has drop issues, at 11% drop rate. Hate his effort on routes, he doesn’t work to get open and he’s lazy.
take: Boutte is a case of all the talent in the world but non of the effort. It makes me upset to watch such a physically talented WR play the way he does.
WR Jalin Hyatt Tennessee 74
info: Hyatt was a 4 star recruit out of Dutch Fork HS in SC where he led his team to back to back undefeated seasons while breaking his HS's receiving records .He initially committed to play of the Hokies before flipping his commitment to Tennessee. His Freshman year he got on start and had some use getting 276 receiving yards and 2 TDs. his sophomore year was more of the same but really broke out in 2022 and developed a great connection with Hendon Hooker. In 2022 he won the Biletnikoff and was named to the 1st team All SEC team after racking up 1,267 yards and 15 TDs.
pros: Accolades his senior year where as good as it gets. Great speed, can put on the burners and pull away from people. Solid hands, not just a speed guy who can't catch, he can catch through contact.
cons: One year of being a full time starter. Mostly a slot receiver in college, 87% of his snaps from there. Only got a 77 PFF grade, not whatyou expect from the Biletnikoff winner. Very thin frame, needs to add some size for NFL physicality. Awful out of the break and off the line, not quick just fast.
take: Hyatt can run fast, that's about where the positives end. He's not a polished receiver, he's not good out of breaks and doesn't do well with physicality. His top end outcome is a deep threat only.
WR Parker Washington Penn St 74
info: 46 receptions 611 yards 2 TDs.
pros: Stocky build at 5’10 215 and a true junior. Good hands, 5% drop and a surprisingly high contested catch rate. Unreal ball skills, can catch a ball in any position and can catch away from his body. Can add YAC with his center of gravity and strong lower half.
cons: Never really was the alpha in the receiving core, best season came with Jahan Dotson as the number 1. Not that fast and shifty for the play style that would fit his build. Doesn’t create the separation with his routes that you would like from a 5’10 slot guy.
take: Washington is an interesting eval, he’s got a weird stocky build for the position and isn’t that top end athlete. But, he’s very good with the ball in his hands and can go pluck the ball out of the air if it’s within his range. He will be able to step in as a return man and if he gets craftier with his routes he could be a great slot.
WR Cedric Tillman Tennessee 73
info: 37 receptions 417 yards 3 TDs.
pros: Good size, 6’3 215. Solid hands, 5% career drop rate. Good body control and making plays on the ball through contact.
cons: Injured for his final season for 6 weeks causing production to drop off. 1 out of 5 years he caught more than 40 balls. Not a good athlete, not quick and the speed is average.
take: Tillman had a great 4th season where he had over 1,000 yards after a down first 3 years. He came back for his 5th and final year to add on to his production but he got hurt. He’s a big bodied receiver that can make a play on the ball no matter who’s on him but he’s not that good athlete that will create separation.
WR Nathaniel Dell Houston 73
info: 108 receptions 1,399 yards 17 TDs.
pros: Back-to-back 1,300 yard receiving seasons with 30 TDs. Amazing athlete, has the agility and speed you need to play at 165. Great deep threat with the ability to shake defenders deep and be wide open.
cons: Drops the ball more than you would like at 9%. 5’10 165, he’s a very small receiver. Played against lower level of competition than you would like.
take: Dell is Zay flowers but older and played at Houston. He’s way undersized but he’s such a great athlete he made up for it. He can be a teams return man as well as maybe develop into a deep threat out of the slot.
