C John Michael-Schmitz Minnesota 79
info: 2,495 career snaps 92.4 RBLK 81 PBLK 8 pressures.
pros: Remington award winner and the top graded center at 92.3.4 seasons of over 400 snaps with over 80 PFF grades. Good center size at 6’4 320, not a typical undersized lineman. Solid strength for a center, can anchor well against bull rushes. Great zone blocker, runs his feet well and gives high effort. Good IQ in pass pro and uses his hands well.
cons: Older prospect, going to be 24 in the NFL. Plays high leaving him vulnerable to be out leveraged. Would like to see more power in the run game by vertically moving people off the ball.
take: Michael Schmitz is ready to step in and play center in the NFL, he was fairly dominate in college which should allow him to be a serviceable starting center. The upside isn’t really there, he isn’t a special athlete but he’s solid and that’s whats needed in the center position.
C Rickey Stromberg Arkansas 75
info: 3,121 career snaps 83.7 RBLK 77.1 PBLK 11 pressures.
pros: Solid size at 6’4 315 with 33 inch arms and 22 years old. 4 year starter that improved every year of his career. Good strength in the run game, can turn DL as well as drive LBs back. Has a solid anchor and a good feel for blitzes and stunts in pass pro.
cons: In the games where he played NFL talent you can see him struggle more than you would like. Leans a little too much in pass pro, needs to sink and play lower. Not high level athlete, wont wow anyone with blocks in space.
take: Stromberg is an impressive center, he can be dominate in the run game and he’s solid in pass pro. He checks all the boxes you want in a center and should be able to start as a rookie.
C Joe Tippmann Wisconsin 77
info: 1,456 career snaps 78 RBLK 79.2 PBLK 5 pressures.
pros: Wisconsin lineman that is 21 6’6 315 and has played good football every year. He has a sick mullet, he looks the part. Really good athlete for his size, can pull and play in space. Solid in pass pro, locks on defenders and keeps them infront of him. Solid strength, he can anchor well and shows plays in the run game where he can move the LOS
cons: At 6’6 he’s a high cut center, going to struggle to out leverage NTs. Not consistent with his use of power because of leverage. Can get off balance from bending at the waist too much because of height.
take: Weird to say but if Tippmann was about 2-3 inches shorter he may be an early day 2 pick. Many of his weaknesses are due to a lack of leverage but he’s a good athlete that’s young and has shown some power. He should be able to be a low end early on starter and develop into a solid center.
C Olusegun Oluwatimi Michigan 71
info: 3,479 snaps 83 RBLK 76.7 PBLK 9 pressures.
pros: Very experienced guard that has played for 3 schemes (Air Force, Virginia, Michigan). Had a 90 RBLK grade in 2021 at Virginia. Does a good job picking up blitzes and stunts, has seen a lot of fronts. Good athlete, can pull and log around the line as well as mirror defenders. Good in double teams, always gets a good push and can climb to a backer.
cons: Would like to see a bigger center at 6’3 307. He’s Not the strongest OL and he doesn’t play with good pad level. Isn’t a dog in the run game, likes to just do enough and get in the way, not drive the defender back.
take: Oluwatimi is a very experienced center with good enough strength and solid athleticism. He wont do much to wow you on tape but he has a good IQ and gets the job done nearly every time. He can most likely step in and play if you need to fill in an interior spot in the OL.
C Luke Wypler Ohio St 75
info: 1,702 career snaps 80.8 RBLK 84.1 PBLK.
pros: Top 2 center recruit in 2020, he’s still a young player. 2 straight solid years as the starter. Good athlete, moves exceptionally well in space. Works hard to stay on blocks.
cons: Small at 6’3 300. Gets out powered way too often, both in the run and pass.
take: Wypler is the typical college center in the fact that he is small at only 300 pounds. Where he differs is his athleticism, he’s a very toned down Linderbaum. He needs to add strength to his game but he’s young enough that it is a real possibility that he can down the line.
C Jake Andrews Troy 68
info: 2,796 snaps 77.1 RBLK 56.5 PBLK 19 pressures. 6’3 319 with 32 ¼ arms
pros: Can play all 3 interior positions. Good hand usage, refits hands and good placement. Solid size, thick build that wont get run over.
cons: Doesn’t have any athleticism, his feet move very slow and it hurts in pass pro. He won’t move anyone off the ball, he doesn’t come off the ball well to drive NT back.
take: Andrews is a thick center that has played a lot of football in the interior OL. He’s a low ceiling guy because his athleticism and power are not NFL level but he’s played solid. He should be signed to see if he can be a good backup for the interior OL for a team.
C Juice Scruggs Penn St 74
info: 1,982 snaps 69.9 RBLK 73.6 PBLK 14 pressures. 6’3 308 with 33 3/8 arms.
pros: Solid center size at 6’3 308 with over 33 inch arms. Solid athlete, can move and get to the 2nd level. Smart player, picks up stunts well.
cons: Doesn’t have the best power, bigger DT won’t be moved off the ball.
take: Scruggs is a good smart center. He’s got the build of a high end center and the athleticism to  be a good zone blocking center. He may struggle with power though, he doesn’t create too much movement off the ball and may be susceptible to a bull rush.
C Alan Ali TCU 68
info: 4,079 snaps 62.6 RBLK 69.6 PBLK 24 pressures. 6’4 300.
pros: 5 year starter with over 4000 snaps. Has taken snaps at all 5 positions on the OL. Smart player that can pick up stunts and get off his combo blocks.
cons: Doesn’t have the traits you want in the NFL, power and athleticism are mediocre. Feet aren’t fast, cant reach someone far away. Can get bull rushed too easy.
take: Ali is an experienced versatile lineman which has the makings of a good backup. He doesn’t have the physical ability you want in a prospect, he’s not an athlete and isn’t very strong but he is smart.
C Alex Forsyth Oregon 72
info: 1,983 snaps 70.3 RBLK 85.8 PBLK 1 pressure. 6’4 310.
pros: Only allowed 1 pressure in 2022. Solid athlete, can reach and get to the second level. Smart player, made calls for the Oregon OL.
cons: Not a powerful player, he wont knock anyone off the ball. May struggle anchoring in the NFL.
take: Forsyth was the anchor of the Oregon offensive line, he made all the calls and has a high IQ. He also is a pretty good athlete as well with the ability to move in space. He’s just lacking the power to make him a great prospect, he’s probably limited to a zone scheme.
