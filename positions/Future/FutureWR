info: 21 years old. Stewart was the nations top WR recruit out of Frisco Texas after moving there for football from Memphis. He was coached by Jason Witten and was an All American in football while winning the Texas 5A long jump and 4x400. He committed to Texas A&M where he stated immediately and was named to the Freshman All American team. He started his 2023 season off hot before dealing with a leg injury for the end of the season. He chose to transfer to Oregon when the coaching staff for A&M was changing.
Pros: Elite track star. Former top recruit. Electric with the ball in his hands, can make guys miss. Elite long speed, can get vertical. Great change of direction ability.
Cons: Very skinny, needs to keep adding weight. Doesn’t handle physicality well. Hands are questionable.
take: Stewart is an elite athlete with great speed, explosiveness, and change of direction. He’s not a polished receiver at all, he needs to work on his routes and hands but he’s a talented player.
