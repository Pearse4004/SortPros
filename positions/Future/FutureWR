WR Marvin Harrison Ohio St 96
size: *6'3 205, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 receptions 0 yards 0 TDs, 0 RECV 0 drops 0% Contested
info: Harrison has some top tier genetics, his father Marvin Harrison Sr was a hall of fame receiver that was one of the best to ever do it. Harrison was a 4 star recruit out of St Josephs Prep in Philly where he broke conference records for receiving. He committed to OSU over Syracuse for some reason where he sat behind Olave, Wilson and JSN as a true freshman before becoming the guy in 2022. He went for 1,263 yards and 14 TDs while being an All American and somehow snubbed for the Biletnikoff.
pros: Very good speed, can easily stack corners and create separation with speed. Great speed off the ball, accelerates and eats space very well. Great hands, drops wont be a problem for him. Ball skills are top tier, can extend away from his body to make spectacular plays. Great at setting up CBs to get them off balance. Great hands at the release, can get defenders off him easily. Press is nothing for him, great at getting off it. Great body control and can play through contact, makes for some spectacular catches.
cons: Not much of a YAC receiver, not much of a screen target receiver.
take: Harrison is the best receiver prospect I’ve ever seen, he’s a different beast. If you don’t need a QB he should be the first player off the board in nearly every draft.
