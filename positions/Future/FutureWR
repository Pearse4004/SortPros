WR Tetairoa McMillan Arizona 84

Cons: Not the quickest twitch WR. Not scary to break tackles 1 on 1. Not a separator against man.
take: McMillan is your prototypical big X receiver that has great hands. He is very good at finding the soft spots in zone and athletic enough to take advantage of it. He’s a talented WR that can be a WR1 in the NFL.

WR Emeka Egbuka Ohio St 83
size: *6'1 206, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

He came back in 2023 and delt with injuries and worse QB play which drastically reduced his production.
Pros: Top level recruit at OSU that was good as a true sophomore. Good size. Great acceleration off the line. Good hands, catches away from his body. Good at the top of routes, uses hands and sells routes well. Great at attacking leverage of defenders to set up breaks. Solid with the ball in his hands, gets upfield and can run through bad tackles.

take: Egbuka is a polished Ohio State WR with good routes, hands, and solid athleticism. He has all the tools and ability to immediately be a starting NFL WR. The only draw back is that he’s not the elite athlete with the upside of a top 10 NFL WR.

Cons: Very small receiver. Slot only. No physicality, will fall down on contact.
take: Johnson is an electric athlete that has produced at a high level. He’s going to be a slot only and will struggle with physicality but he’s a good enough athlete to overcome his size and produce.

WR Julian Fleming Ohio St 69
size: *6'2 209, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

Pros: Top tier recruit that learned to play WR at Ohio St. Good size. Good straight line speed.
Cons: Couldn’t get production at OSU with all the talent there. Slow out of breaks. Not a plus receiver with the ball.
take: Fleming had a disappoint career, he’s the rare top recruit that didn’t get into trouble and didn’t pan out. He’s got the size and speed to be an NFL receiver but thats really the only strengths. He’s not great with the ball in his hands and doesn’t move that well in his routes. He can be a bottom of the roster WR.
