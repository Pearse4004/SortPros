OG Jaeden Roberts Alabama 69
size: *6'5 315, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 career snaps 0 pressures, 0 RBLK 0 PBLK
info: Roberts was a 3 star recruit out of North Shore in Houston TX. He received multiple SEC offers and committed to Bama. He didn’t play at all in 2021 and sparingly played in 2022. In 2023 he took over the starting job after week 3 and didn’t let go.
Pros: Mauler in the run game, once his hands are on you he’s finishing the block. Great size, prototype. Works hands well.
Cons: Leans on guys heavily, constantly off balance. Slow and lazy feet. Slow to react to stunts. Always on the ground. Loses badly.
take: Roberts looks the part and is a mauler in the run game. He just is just slow in everything he does, his feet, get off and reactions are slow. If he can work on his agility and footwork he can be a starting NFL OL.

OG DJ Campbell Texas 69
size: *6'3 330, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 career snaps 0 pressures, 0 RBLK 0 PBLK

Pros: Great size. Good power. Good recruit. See’s stunts and picks up defenders well.
Cons: Doesn’t move particularly well. Balance is an issue. Slow to react. Technique is off, feet are not ideal.
take: Campbell is a big strong guard that has the physical ability of an NFL OL. He’s got a long way to go on technique and his mobility is lacking. He may be able to become an NFL lineman with development.

Pros: Played both tackle and guard. Solid athlete, good movement skills. In solid position most of the time. Good flexibility in stance.
Cons: Very old prospect. Not much power or aggression. Limited length. Not good at throwing punches.
take: Petry is a solid athlete that is an average college lineman. He's already 26 though and his physical potential is probably maxed out and the strength isn't there. He could be a rookie camp body.

Cons: Slow feet on contact, holds a lot. Plays off balance. Slow feet.

Cons: High cut tackle, wish he was a little shorter. Not an agile athlete, on the ground too often. Not a people mover.
take: Mahlman is the prototypical Wisconsin RT, big, strong, and good technique. He’s elite in pass pro with his feet and hands as well as very good in the zone run game. He’s just not the top tier athlete that will get drafted at the top of the draft, but hes a good Starting NFL OT.

Cons: Doesn’t play with much aggression. Hands and feet are average, need technique work.

size: *6'3 304, NA arms, NA hands.

Pros: Moves pretty well, solid athlete. Good power in the run game, can move guys.
Cons: Plays a little out of control, sometimes wandering. Not the longest tackle, probably a guard. Lets length into his chest and gets bulled. Dallas Turner beat him bad.
take: Wade is a powerful OL with solid athleticism. He struggles on the edge dealing with length so he should get kicked inside. If he makes the switch and gets his assignments and technique down he could start.

OT Joshua Gray Oregon St 69
size: *6'4 305, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

Pros: Very experienced, 5 year starter at LT. Always had solid PFF grades. Good athlete, moves well and can run.
Cons: Older prospect. Not the biggest OL. Sloppy feet in pass pro, gets narrow. On the ground a decent amount. Guys slip off his blocks.
take: Gray is a very experienced OL with solid play over his career. He’s inconsistent because he has reps where he mirrors guys well and moves people in the run game, but then there are reps his feet get tangles and he can’t stay on a block. He should definitely get an NFL shot but it will be tough to see him as a starter.

OT Enrique Cruz Syracuse 68

Cons: Slow off the line in the run game. Let defenders get inside too easily. Lunges in pass pro. Plays out of control. Sloppy hands, placement is not good.

take: Majors is an NFL average center, he’s smart, physical, and experienced. He has a lot of snaps at a big time level and has blocked well. He’s not overpowering or really adding to the run game but he could start in the NFL.
