size: *6'5 335, NA arms, NA hands.

Cons: Leans on guys heavily, constantly off balance. Slow and lazy feet. Slow to react to stunts. Always on the ground. Loses badly.
take: Roberts looks the part and is a mauler in the run game. He just is just slow in everything he does, his feet, get off and reactions are slow. If he can work on his agility and footwork he can be a starting NFL OL.

OG DJ Campbell Texas 69
size: *6'3 330, NA arms, NA hands.

Cons: Doesn’t move particularly well. Balance is an issue. Slow to react. Technique is off, feet are not ideal.

Pros: Played both tackle and guard. Solid athlete, good movement skills. In solid position most of the time. Good flexibility in stance.
Cons: Very old prospect. Not much power or aggression. Limited length. Not good at throwing punches.
take: Petry is a solid athlete that is an average college lineman. He's already 26 though and his physical potential is probably maxed out and the strength isn't there. He could be a rookie camp body.

OG Jakob Bradford Syracuse 65
size: *6'5 309, NA arms, NA hands.

Pros: Solid size. Solid aggression.
Cons: Slow feet on contact, holds a lot. Plays off balance. Slow feet.

Cons: Needs a stronger anchor. Not very aggressive in the run game. Off balance too often in the run game.
Take: Banks has the potential to be an elite pass protector in the NFL. He’s got the size and moves very well for it as well as uses his hands well.  He's only missing the top level aggression and physicality that would make him a top tier prospect.

OT Riley Mahlman Wisconsin 79
size: *6'8 320, NA arms, NA hands.

Cons: Feet slow down on contact, need to keep moving to protect the edge. Not the most impressive athlete.
take: Miller is a talented OT with a lot of good film. He played as a true freshman at a big time program and wasn’t a liability. He has solid pass sets and can move guys in the run game. He’s not the most physically talented OL prospect but he’s very good.

OT Emery Jones LSU 78
size: *6'6 320, NA arms, NA hands.

Pros: Works hard in the run game. Got the job done in pass pro, didn’t get beat too often. Moves well, good athlete.
Cons: On the skinnier side, should add more mass. Pass pro hands are mediocre, doesn’t get hands on well. Sloppy looking pass pro.
take: Cornelius is a long athletic tackle that has played well in his college career. He’s on the skinnier side so he will have to build up his strength more and develop his hand technique to be a starting NFL OT.

OT Josh Simmons Ohio St 71
size: *6'5 310, NA arms, NA hands.

Cons: Not the most athletic tackle, doesn't move as well as you would like. Lets guys into his chest. Pass sets are not great, turns shoulders early.
take: Simmons is a big solid athlete that excels in the run game. He can really move people but he’s a liability in pass pro on the edge. If he is kicked into guard he could be a solid NFL player.

Pros: Moves pretty well, solid athlete. Good power in the run game, can move guys.
Cons: Plays a little out of control, sometimes wandering. Not the longest tackle, probably a guard. Lets length into his chest and gets bulled. Dallas Turner beat him bad.
take: Wade is a powerful OL with solid athleticism. He struggles on the edge dealing with length so he should get kicked inside. If he makes the switch and gets his assignments and technique down he could start.

OT Joshua Gray Oregon St 69
size: *6'4 305, NA arms, NA hands.

Pros: Very experienced, 5 year starter at LT. Always had solid PFF grades. Good athlete, moves well and can run.
Cons: Older prospect. Not the biggest OL. Sloppy feet in pass pro, gets narrow. On the ground a decent amount. Guys slip off his blocks.
take: Gray is a very experienced OL with solid play over his career. He’s inconsistent because he has reps where he mirrors guys well and moves people in the run game, but then there are reps his feet get tangles and he can’t stay on a block. He should definitely get an NFL shot but it will be tough to see him as a starter.

OT Enrique Cruz Syracuse 68
size: *6’6 311, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

Pros: Looks the part, well built tackle that holds size well. Moves well, fast feet for a OL in pass pro.
Cons: Slow off the line in the run game. Let defenders get inside too easily. Lunges in pass pro. Plays out of control. Sloppy hands, placement is not good.

OT Josh Fryar Ohio St 68
size: *6'6 313, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

Pros: Shows flashes of good hands in pass pro. Solid zone blocker.
Cons: Not a very good athlete. Shorter arms. Stiff. No push in the run game.

Cons: Lefty center. Mostly likely a center only, backup guard ability. Not a physically imposing center, doesn’t dominate the point of attack.
take: Majors is an NFL average center, he’s smart, physical, and experienced. He has a lot of snaps at a big time level and has blocked well. He’s not overpowering or really adding to the run game but he could start in the NFL.

size: *6'3 315, NA arms, NA hands.

Cons: Can get over powered by IDL. Not much movement in the run game. One on one pass pro is not high level. Center only.
take: Reed is a solid center, he is smart, athletic enough and plays with solid technique. He’s not a high level center that can dominate the point of attack or anchor a good bull rush well. He can be a solid backup or low end starter in the NFL.
