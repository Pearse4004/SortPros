QB Kedon Slovis BYU 76
info: Coming out of Desert Hill in Arizona Slovis committed to USC to backup JT Daniels. After Daniels got hurt in the season opener Slovis became one of five true freshman USC quarterbacks to start a game for the trojans. He had a great true freshman year and was the PAC 12 Freshman of the year as well as made freshman All-American. He played solid his sophomore year earning an 80 PFF grade while throwing 17 TDs and 7 INTs.
pros: Moves in the pocket well. Feet are always in a good position. Shown ability to go through full field reads. Finds the checkdown well. Throws against the blitz well. Solid accuracy underneath
cons: Doesn’t have a good arm. Threw a lot of outs that wouldn’t work in the NFL. Puts the ball in harm’s way too much.
takeaway: Slovis has shown the ability to go through multiple reads and get the ball out of his hand. The only issue is his arm strength doesn’t compare to top quarterbacks in the NFL which limits his ceiling. Reminds me a little of Josh Rosen.
