QB Cam Ward Washington St 76
size: *6'1 223, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 25 TD 7 INT 3,723 yards 66.7%, 79.1 PASS 69.7 RUN 23 BTT 20 TWP
info: 22 Years old.
pros: Well-built frame, good amount of mass on him. Solid zip on the ball, can fire shots in between zones. Can throw off platform and from different angles. Good athlete, can scramble and extend plays as well as run the ball.
cons: On the shorter side of quarterbacks. A few too many plays where the read is off and he doesn’t see the open man.
take: Ward is a talented QB that had a lot of success at Washinton State. He has a good arm to go along with his athleticism which make him very hard to stop. He could very well end up being a good starter in the NFL is he just keeps developing.


QB KJ Jefferson Arkansas 70
size: *6’3 243, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 TD 0 INT 0000 yards 0%, 0 PASS 0 RUN 0 BTT 0 TWP
info: 22 Years old. Jefferson was a 4 star recruit out of North Panola in MS. He received offers from many SEC schools and chose Arkansas. He was a back up his first 2 seasons and backed up future NFL TE Felipe Franks. He took over in 2021 with star receiver Treylon Burks as his number one target and threw for 2,574 yards and 21 TDs. He followed that up with another 2,300 yard season and 22 TDs.
pros: Big strong QB, has great size and strength to play QB. Throws from a solid base, good feet. Good athlete, can be a designed run game QB.
cons: Eyes down and run when any pressure arrives, needs to keep his eyes up. Not accurate, misses throws constantly. Doesn’t see the field well, locks in to one receiver. Arm isn’t NFL average, the zip isn’t there.
take: Jefferson is a big strong QB that has had a lot of success at Arkansas. He’s lacking the arm talent to get him drafted early but he has the body type and athletic ability to play in the NFL.
