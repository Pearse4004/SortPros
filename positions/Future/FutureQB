QB Kyle McCord Syracuse 69
size: *6'2 215, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 TD 0 INT 0000 yards 0%, 0 PASS 0 RUN 0 BTT 0 TWP
info: 22 years old. McCord was a high 4 star recruit out of St Josephs Prep in NJ where he won a state championship and committed to OSU. He sat behind Stroud for 2 years before taking the starting job and bringing OSU to a 1 loss season and a 3rd team All Big 10 recognition. He transferred to Cuse to help Fran brown turn around the program for his final year.
pros: Good accuracy, puts the ball where he wants it. Catchable ball, nice spin and good touch. Solid pocket mobility, doesn’t get sacked much. Delivers the ball when getting hit. Pushes the ball down the field well. Solid zip on his passes. Can go through progression and work the ball to a check down.
cons: Had a loaded OSU team in 2023 and wasn’t dominant. Poor decision maker, lapses in judgment and forces to ball to his first read. Doesn’t scramble, needs to pick up easy yards with his legs. Wouldn’t be classified as a play maker.
take: McCord would be classified as a game manager, he’s not the QB to come in and take over games. The issue is he makes a lot of weird decisions where he can’t come off his first read and puts the ball in harms way. He’s a talented QB with solid size and athleticism to go with an NFL arm, but he doesn’t lift a team like top picks do.






QB Cade Klubnik Clemson 75
size: *6'2 205, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

Info: 21 years old. 5 star recruit out of Westlake TX. Gatorade player of the year in Texas. 2 time USA Today OPOY. MVP of elite 11 camp. 3 time state champion while going undefeated. Backed up DJ in 2022 before getting put in the ACC championship game and starting the bowl game. He took over as the full time starter in 2023.
Pros: Highly decorated HS career. Solid athleticism, can move in the pocket and get away from pressure. Solid arm strength, has some zip. Good footwork, throws from a good base. Flashes high level reps. Will hit checkdowns well.
Cons: Didn’t break out as a young player. Not a precise passer, doesn’t lead receivers well. Doesn’t go through progressions well. Doesn’t read defenses at a high level. On the thinner side, needs to bulk up.
Take: Klubnik is a talented young QB that has good athleticism and a solid arm. He’s still developing in terms of getting bigger and learning defenses but he has the talent to be an NFL starter.

QB Quinn Ewers Texas 73
size: *6'2 195, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 TD 0 INT 0000 yards 0%, 0 PASS 0 RUN 0 BTT 0 TWP
Info: 21 years old. One of the highest recruits ever, 5 star out of Southlake Carroll TX. Committed to OSU before transferring the Texas. He started immediately at Texas and was named 2nd team All Big 12 in his second year starting.
Pros: Top recruit. Very real arm talent, flicks the ball where he wants. Mobile enough to get outside the pocket. Throws with great touch.
Cons: Bad attitude at the elite 11. Thinner frame. Plays with no sense of urgency. Don’t see many high level reads and progressions.
Take: Ewers is a talented passer that has high level arm talent. He is accurate and can push the ball down the field. He isn’t a high level QB as of right now though, he doesn’t read and anticipate the defense very well and is a little lackadaisical. He needs to dedicate to football and really hone in on his craft to be a starting NFL QB.


QB Drew Allar Penn St 70
size: *6'5 240, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 TD 0 INT 0000 yards 0%, 0 PASS 0 RUN 0 BTT 0 TWP
Info: 21 years old. Top QB 5 star recruit out of Medina OH where he was MR Football. He committed to Penn State where he had to wait a year to become the starter. Once He became the starter he had a solid sophomore season.
Pros: Great pedigree, top recruit at a big program. Great size, prototype. Strong arm, can push the ball into windows. Runs an offense pretty well, lot of decisions in the run game.
Cons: Not very accurate, doesn’t fit the ball into tight windows. Slower to progress through reads. Not a very good athlete. Bad base when throwing especially under pressure.
Take: Allar is a big strong old school QB that plays the position conservatively. He doesn’t make many mistakes but isn’t much of a play maker. He could develop into a starter but has a long way to go.

QB Kyron Drones Virginia Tech 68
size: *6'2 230, NA arms, NA hands.

Cons: Doesn’t read defenses at a high level. Not accurate. Long release. Doesn’t throw from a good base. Locked on receivers too often.
Take: Drones is a physically gifted athlete, he is a top tier runner as a QB and has the size to back it up. His arm is fine but theres a lot of work to do in the pass game. He needs to work on his feet and mental side of the game.
