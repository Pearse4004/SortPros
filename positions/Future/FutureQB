QB Michael Penix Washington 80
size: 6’2 213, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 TD 0 INT 0000 yards 0%, 0 PASS 0 RUN 0 BTT 0 TWP
info: 23 years old. Penix was a 3 star recruit out of Tampa Bat Tech and chose to take his talents to Indiana. He was a team captain for them and a playmaker serving as team captain in 2020 and 2021. He transferred to Washington and had an all time season, he threw for 4,354 yards and 29 touchdowns and was named the comeback player of the year.
pros: Team captain for 2 different teams. Serious arm talent, does a great job with ball placement especially down the field. Keeps the ball out of harms way, has a low turnover worthy play rate. Great at throwing on the run and off platform. Good athlete that can make things happen with his legs.
cons: He’s a lefty, don’t like the way his throwing motion looks. Would like to see him work the pocket more than scramble. Lack of tight area throws, played in a friendly offense that protected him well and had a good amount of schemed throws. 3 straight years of injuries to start his career. His base isn’t that good, he drifts, is a little toesy and doesn’t set all the time.
take: There isn’t much not to like about Penix on field play, he has a solid arm with great accuracy to go along with his plus athleticism. Whenever he plays he seems to win and the offense runs well, but staying on the field has been his biggest issue.
QB KJ Jefferson Arkansas 70
size: *6’3 243, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 TD 0 INT 0000 yards 0%, 0 PASS 0 RUN 0 BTT 0 TWP
info: 22 Years old. Jefferson was a 4 star recruit out of North Panola in MS. He received offers from many SEC schools and chose Arkansas. He was a back up his first 2 seasons and backed up future NFL TE Felipe Franks. He took over in 2021 with star receiver Treylon Burks as his number one target and threw for 2,574 yards and 21 TDs. He followed that up with another 2,300 yard season and 22 TDs.
pros: Big strong QB, has great size and strength to play QB. Throws from a solid base, good feet. Good athlete, can be a designed run game QB.
cons: Eyes down and run when any pressure arrives, needs to keep his eyes up. Not accurate, misses throws constantly. Doesn’t see the field well, locks in to one receiver. Arm isn’t NFL average, the zip isn’t there.
take: Jefferson is a big strong QB that has had a lot of success at Arkansas. He’s lacking the arm talent to get him drafted early but he has the body type and athletic ability to play in the NFL.
