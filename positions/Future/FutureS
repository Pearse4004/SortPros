S Alijah Clark Syracuse 68
size: 6'1 186, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 tackles 0 INT 0 PBU, 0 RDEF 0 TACK 0 COV
info: 22 years old. Clark was a 4 star recruit out of Camden NJ who played along side fellow Cuse teammate Duce Chestnut. He stayed close to home and committed to Rutgers where he didn’t see much playing time. He transferred to Cuse in 2022 to play with Duce and started every year he was at Cuse.
Pros: Comes downhill fast, wants to get in the action. Good in man, can lock down TE’s and slots. Good change of direction. Solid speed.
Cons: On the skinnier side, needs to add some mass at safety. Not a very sound tackler. Follows the QBs eyes a lot and doesn’t see routes develop.
take: Clark is a very good athlete with good coverage skills. He can man up in the slot and play well in zone, but he’s not a true safety. He is a below average tackler at a skinnier frame which won't hold up in the league.
