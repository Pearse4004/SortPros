test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: 21 years old. Bowser was a top 2 TE recruit coming out of Napa CA where he was given a 4 star rating and offers from many of the power 5 schools. He chose to go with Georgia over any school close to him in California to play in the SEC. Bowers immediately proved he was a top tight end in the nation catching 56 balls and 13 TDs as a true freshman which ended in a national championship. He kept up the high level of play in 2022 catch 63 balls for 942 yards and another National championship as well as an All American bid.
pros: Production off the charts, the top receiver on Georgia since day 1. Great ball skills, good concentration and sticky hands. Good body control, can adjust to the ball in air at a high level. Good blocker in space, good feet and dominates DBs. Great with the ball in his hands, manufactured touches for him to work in space. Good athlete, outruns LBs down the field and can hit home runs from the TE position.
cons: Not a good inline blocker, needs to add some muscle or become more aggressive. Separation with his athleticism doesn’t scare DBs, quickness isn’t elite.
take: Bowers is the second best receiving TE I’ve seen out of college. Besides Kyle Pitts, Bowers has some of the mot impressive receiving reps out of any TE in the NCAA. He’s a great athlete with very strong hands and great body control that allows him to be a receiving threat immediately in the NFL. If he can become a more willing and violent blocker he will be one of if not the best TE in the NFL.
