TE Oronde Gadsden Syracuse 73
size: *6’5 223, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 receptions 0 yards 0 TDs, 0 RECV 0 RBLK 0% drop 0% contested
info: 22 years old. Gadsden who is the son of a former NFL player was a 4 year varsity WR for former NFL CB Patrick Surtain in Florida. He was a 2 time state champion and a team captain which led him to be a 3 star recruit and a Syracuse Commit. He didn’t play much his freshman year then made the switch to TE in 2022 and became a breakout TE star receiving for nearly 1000 yards and being named 1st team All ACC. He had a disappointing 2023 season due to a foot injury and missing most of it.
Pros: Great production in 2022 with a worse QB. Can find space between zones. Great receiving threat as a TE, can play X. Makes good adjustments to the ball when it’s in the air. Solid at stalk blocking in space.
Cons: Not a strong TE that you can rely on blocking. Tweener, only plus position is big slot. Foot injury hurt progression for a year.
take: Gadsden is a unique player, he’s listed at TE but plays big slot as well as X and Wing. He’s a great receiver for a TE with good athleticism and great ball skills but he’s not thick enough to play actual TE. He will either need to add a lot more mass or be a back of the roster situational TE.
