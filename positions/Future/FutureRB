RB Quinton Cooley Liberty 70
size: *5'7 210, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
info: 24 years old. Cooley was a 3 star recruit out of Bailey NC where he dominated and scored 54 TDs as a senior. He committed to wake forrest but didn’t get many reps there before transferring to Liberty. At Liberty he became the guy in the backfield breaking out for over 1,400 yards and 16 TDs.
pros: Break out in 2023 where he had over 1400 yards. Very quick first step, hits the hole fast. Solid contact balance, low center of gravity. Runs extremely hard.
cons: Almost no receiving experience. No long speed, not a home run hitter. Produced against lower level of competition. Smaller back, short so can’t carry that much weight.
take: Cooley is a hard running quick back that was a work horse for Liberty. He doesn’t have the size or the speed to be a plus starting NFL back, but he’s good enough to play in the league.

RB Peny Boone UCF 71
size: *6'1 242, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
Info: Boone was a 4 star recruit coming out of detroit where he won 2 state championships. He committed to Maryland where he didn’t see much playing time before transferring to Toledo. He made an impact in 2023, running for over 1,300 yards and 15 TDs winning the MAC Offensive player of the year. That season lead him back to FBS and transferred to UCF.
Pros: Break out 2023 season being the MAC OPOY. Great size. Always runs his feet through contact. Solid acceleration with his size.
Cons: Didn’t do much for his first 3 years in college. Fumbling issue. Doesn’t have the quick cutting ability of top tier backs.
Take: Boone has the size and athleticism of an NFL back and the mentality to get extra yards. He’s not the juiced up explosive RB that are the top tier RBs in the NFL but he can definitely be an NFL RB, even a solid starter.

RB Kaytron Allen Penn St 75
size: *5'11 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
Info: 22 years old. Allen was a 4 star recruit out of IMG where he was a team captain. He committed to Penn St the same year as Nick Singelton which shows he’s not scared of competition. As a true freshman and junior he ran for 800+ yards each year while splitting time with Singleton and even graded higher than him.
Pros: Productive every year. Good vision see’s the cutback lanes well. Solid change of direction. Solid acceleration. Nice ability to make one man miss.
Cons: Not very fast, just average. Not a big powerful back. Doesn’t break many tackles.
Take: Allen is a very good RB back, even better in college then his teammate Singleton. He has great vision and very good movement skills to make the cuts necessary to hit the open lanes. He’s just not the overly impressive Physical RB with his average speed and strength.


RB Nick Singleton Penn St 78
size: *6'0 224, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
info: 21 years old. Singleton was a very highly rated RB coming out of Mifflin HS in PA. He was the 2021 Gatorade national player of the year where he was the first player in PA ever to win it. Not only was he great on the field, off the field he was named to his county all academic team and volunteers on the side. He was a 5 star recruit and committed to Penn state where he ran for over 1k yards in his true freshman season.
pros: As a true freshman dominated with over 1000 yards. Good size. Impressive athlete. Quick feet. Good speed. Good receiving threat, solid hands and good in space. Great acceleration. Strong runner, runs through contact.
cons: Fumbling issue. Never was the alpha RB, always split time. Step back in 2023 from his true freshman season. Vision is questionable, doesn’t anticipate the play developing well.
take: Singleton is one of the most talented backs in college with his great athleticism. He has what you can't teach, great speed, easy change of direction and soft hands. If he hits his ceiling he will be one of the best RBs in the NFL, and can be an All pro player.






RB Jaydn Ott Cal 76
size: *6'0 200, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
Info: 22 years old. Ott was a 4 star recruit after playing at Bishop Gorman and Norco HS in CA where he was a star RB. He committed to Cal and immediately was a starter and ran for nearly 900 yards as a true freshman. He followed that up with a 1,300 yard season and cemented himself as a top back in the nation.
Pros: Good production every year. Good speed. Good vision. Can run through arm tackles.
Cons: Not a juiced up RB, quick cuts and acceleration isn’t his game. Not a overly physical back, wont plow through defenders.
Take: Ott is a very talented back with good speed and vision. He is a home run threat in the open field and will get you what is blocked every time. He’s not the next level athlete that is explosive enough to break tackles regularly which will limit his ceiling.
