RB Omarion Hampton North Carolina 83
size: *6'0 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
info: 22 years old. Hampton was a 4 star prospect out of Clayton NC where he was the NC Gaotrade Player of the Year. He stayed local and committed to UNC but wasn’t the day one starter. He broke out in 2023 where he rushed for 1,500 yards earning 1st team All ACC and 2nd team All American.
pros: Productive RB, over 1,500 yards in 2023. Great build, very strong lower body. Runs with great pad level. Runs feet through contact. Great contact balance, hard to bring down. Solid out of the backfield, good hands. Good vision and instincts. Great north south runner. Good speed.
cons: Not a juiced up elusive back, wont see him juke anyone out. Change of direction isn’t a strength.
take: Hampton is a no nonsense, physical, north and south runner. He has elite burst and power to get every yard that is blocked for and the ability to break any arm tackle. He is a starting NFL RB that can immediately be a pro bowler.

RB Quinshon Judkins Ole Miss 81
size: *5'11 210, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
info: 21 years old. Former 3 star recruit out of Pike road in Alabama where he lead his team to a 5A State tittle rushing for over 4000 yards in his HS career. He chose Ole Miss over many other top tier programs and immediately made an impact rushing for 1,567 yards as a true freshman and was named to the freshman All American team. He followed that up with another 1,159 yards and an All SEC 1st team honor before transferring to OSU.
pros: Immediately started and made a massive impact in the SEC. Very productive RB. Doesn’t fumble very often. Forces a lot of missed tackles. Physical and solid enough technique to be a good blocker. Keeps legs churning to always fight for yards. Elite burst, can hit very small windows quickly. Muscular build, takes a lot to get him down. Good contact balance. Good vision and instincts.
cons: Not used as a weapon in the receiving game. Not a plus blocker as of now. Doesn’t have the game changing elite speed. Doesn’t do the best job of yards after contact, rarely breaks a tackle to create big plays.
take: Judkins is a hard running RB that has elite burst to go along with his physical running style. He has always produced at a high level and is expected to be a RB 1 immediately in the NFL.


RB Nick Singleton Penn St 78
size: *6'0 224, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
info: 21 years old. Singleton was a very highly rated RB coming out of Mifflin HS in PA. He was the 2021 Gatorade national player of the year where he was the first player in PA ever to win it. Not only was he great on the field, off the field he was named to his county all academic team and volunteers on the side. He was a 5 star recruit and committed to Penn state where he ran for over 1k yards in his true freshman season.
pros: As a true freshman dominated with over 1000 yards. Good size. Impressive athlete. Quick feet. Good speed. Good receiving threat, solid hands and good in space. Great acceleration. Strong runner, runs through contact.
cons: Fumbling issue. Never was the alpha RB, always split time. Step back in 2023 from his true freshman season. Vision is questionable, doesn’t anticipate the play developing well.
take: Singleton is one of the most talented backs in college with his great athleticism. He has what you can't teach, great speed, easy change of direction and soft hands. If he hits his ceiling he will be one of the best RBs in the NFL, and can be an All pro player.

RB Tahj Brooks Texas Tech 77
size: *5'10 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.
stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
Info: 23 years old. Brooks was a solid 3 star recruit with a lot of offers coming out of Manor TX.  He stayed close to home and chose Texas Tech where he got playing time as a true freshman. The next 2 years he lead the team in rushing but didn’t really produce like a top back. That all changed in 2023 where he broke out in a big way rushing for over 1,500 yards.
Pros: Unbelievable 2023 season with 1500 yards and 96 MTF. Lowe center of gravity with good pad level. Great at forcing missed tackles. Runs hard. Great vision. Good patience. Solid burt and agility on jump cuts.
Cons: Took him 4 years to really break out. Not much of a speedster. Not much experience receiving out of the back field.
Take: Brooks is a hard nosed physical runner that has the skills to be a starting NFL RB. He has the Javonte Williams I wont go down trait and he’s extremely hard to tackle.

Pros: Earned his way to the field, was not a high recruit. Good ball security. Great short area shake, makes guys whiff in a phone booth. Great contact balance, tough to get down. Great vision. Great jump cuts. Runs feet through contact. Good receiving. Experienced in many run schemes.
cons: Runs a little high. Not a top tier athlete. Not much power behind his runs.
Take: Giddens is one of the best backs in the NCAA. He has such good vision and feel for the position and does everything well. He is missing that top end athleticism, his speed and power are NFL average but the rest of his game is elite.

RB Ollie Gordon Oklahoma St 77
size: *6'1 211, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

pros: Lead NCAA in rushing in 2023. Dominated the big 12 as a 19 year old. Solid receiving production. Solid at breaking tackles, defenders slide off him. Good speed, can run away especially for size. Strong runner, will get the extra yards through defenders. Solid stiff arm.
cons: Has a knack to dance too much, needs to make quicker decisions. Taller back, center of gravity higher than you like. Vision isn’t as good as elite backs. Not explosive with his cuts.

Info: 22 years old. Ott was a 4 star recruit after playing at Bishop Gorman and Norco HS in CA where he was a star RB. He committed to Cal and immediately was a starter and ran for nearly 900 yards as a true freshman. He followed that up with a 1,300 yard season and cemented himself as a top back in the nation.
Pros: Good production every year. Good speed. Good vision. Can run through arm tackles.
Cons: Not a juiced up RB, quick cuts and acceleration isn’t his game. Not a overly physical back, wont plow through defenders.
Take: Ott is a very talented back with good speed and vision. He is a home run threat in the open field and will get you what is blocked every time. He’s not the next level athlete that is explosive enough to break tackles regularly which will limit his ceiling.

RB Kaytron Allen Penn St 75
size: *5'11 220, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

Pros: Productive every year. Good vision see’s the cutback lanes well. Solid change of direction. Solid acceleration. Nice ability to make one man miss.
Cons: Not very fast, just average. Not a big powerful back. Doesn’t break many tackles.
Take: Allen is a very good RB back, even better in college then his teammate Singleton. He has great vision and very good movement skills to make the cuts necessary to hit the open lanes. He’s just not the overly impressive Physical RB with his average speed and strength.


RB Lequint Allen Syracuse 73
size: *6'0 200, NA arms, NA hands.

stat: 0 attempts 0 yards 0 TDs 0 Fum, 0 RUN 0 RECV 0 MFT
info: 20 years old. Allen was a 3 star recruit without many offers, even after being named NJ Gatorade Player of the year. Lucky for Syracuse he committed and made an impact when Sean Tucker wasn’t on the field. He got one start in Tuckers absence where he had nearly 100 yards and 11 receptions. The next year he took over and was great for the Orange with over 1k yards.
pros: Runs behind his pads, great power and physicality. Strong runner, runs feet through tacklers. Great gap scheme power runner. Good hands, can go out wide.
cons: Vision is questionable, doesn’t make the best reads. Not a quick back that will make defenders whiff. Only a solid athlete.
take: Allen is a downhill runner that runs with great physicality. He’s not looking to avoid contact ever, but that sometimes is to his detriment. He wont be an elusive back that hits the home runs, just a solid back that can do a bit of everything.

Cons: Didn’t do much for his first 3 years in college. Fumbling issue. Doesn’t have the quick cutting ability of top tier backs.
