CB Duce Chestnut Syracuse 68
size: 5'11 205, NA arms, NA hands.
test: 40 - NA | 3 cone - NA | shuttle - NA | vert - NA | broad - NA | bench - NA.

info: Chestnut was a 3 star recruit out of Camden NJ where he played with Aijah Clark. He committed to Cuse and joined Clark to start at CB day 1. He had an amazing freshman year with 3 INTs and was named a Freshman All American and 3rd team All ACC. His second year was a little step back from his freshman year before transferring to LSU for one season. He played a lot his first game then was benched causing him to transfer back to Cuse for the 2024 season.
Pros: Broke out as a freshman with great production. Aggressive player, not scared to tackle. Solid physicality, stronger corner to hold up to big WRs. Plays screens very well.
Cons: Couldn’t cut it at a SEC school. Does not throttle down well. Agility is lacking, takes a while to change direction. Not very fast.
take: Chestnut is a physical corner that plays hard and can stop screens with the best of them. He’s just not a fluid athlete to handle good route runners and recover.
