RB Travis Etienne 85 Clemson
+ 7.8 yards per carry, 2nd all american, doak walker semifinalist, national champ, you don't want to get in a 1v1 tackle with him you will lose, great balance, very sudden with cuts, super fast, servicable hands, great production, vice grip no fumbles, perfect size, great vision, better receiver now
- not a good blocker will get in the way but not going to hold up well, worse with bad oline big surprise
RB Najee Harris 81 Alabama
+ Consensus top 3 recruit, All sec 2nd, .3 broken tackles per carry, packs a punch, stupid vert, not arm tackling him, size speed combo

RB Chuba Hubbard 70 Oklahoma St
+ Fantastic production, canadian, 1st team All American, junior world sprinter, runs with good patience, has break away speed
- Didn't have a great broken tackle rate, 9 fumbles 2 years, not a powerful runner at all, not an explosive athlete, only great with good blocking
RB Pooka Williams 74 Kansas
+ Junior, Sweet name, 4 star, Fresh threw ran and caught a TD, First team big 12, a lot of broken tackles, sudden, more power than you would think, plus athlete
- 4 fumbles 18-19, Arrested for domestic abuse, Small build, can't block, dances sometimes
RB Kylin Hill 74 Mississippi St
+ 2nd team all SEC, brother is trey burton, absurd hurdles, solid receiver, great balance, broke a lot of tackles
- Would like to see more of him sticking his foot in the ground and going north south, not the best power back
RB Rakeem Boyd 70 Arkansas
+ Last Chance U, fights for extra yards, spins on contact, has juice to hit open holes
- bad at breaking tackles, gets the yardage that is blocked for him, not quick
RB Michael Carter 77 North Carolina
+ Florida POY, Broken tackles for days in space, unreal change of direction
