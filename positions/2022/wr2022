WR Garrett Wilson Ohio State 84
info: Garrett Wilson was a highly recruited 5 star receiver coming out of Lake Travis high school. He decided to attend the power house Ohio State and join a loaded receiving core. The crowded room didn’t effect him as he was clearly a top 2 receiver on the team immediately showing impressive ball skills. He improved each year gaining over 1000 yards in 2021 and being named 2nd team Big 10.
pros: Unbelievable body control. Both a smooth route runner as well as twitchy when he needs to be. YAC ability is there with the ability to make people miss. He floats in the air when attacking a jump ball. Spectacular catches all over his film. Tracks the ball well down the field.
cons: Not top tier speed to burn defenders. Not an overly physical player, can get beaten up with physicality. Too many drops for a top tier WR.
take: Watching Wilson play makes you think it must be nice to be able to move like that. His body control is absurd and has seemed to master 0 gravity which is top tier tools for any wide receiver to have.
WR Chris Olave Ohio State 85
info: Olave decided to take his talents to Ohio State after a successful career at Mission Hills in California. He was a 3-sport athlete and ran a 10.8 100m in track. He used that speed to attack downfield where he had 15 catches of over 15 yards. He returned for his senior season to pair with another standout receiver Garrett Wilson to form the best duo in college football. His senior season was more of the same after almost reaching 1000 yards and being named first team Big 10.
pros: 1 drop on 51 catchable passes. Sneaky speed, really gets down the field in a hurry with little effort. Not a body catch on tape, all natural hands. Super flexible, can sink hips and change direction great. Had some solid blocks on tape. Showed that he can shake press and create separation. Super smooth player that is always in control.
cons: Not the strongest receiver, can get out muscled. Rounded routes, not much shake to his routes. Not the best with the ball in his hands.
take: Olave is about as good as it gets at the receiver position. He has some of the best hands in college football and is the best deep threat in the class.
WR Treylon Burks Arkansas 88
info: Arkansas surprisingly actually kept the top recruit in the state in state.  The 4 star WR out of Warren committed to the razorbacks and immediately was their best WR. Playing mostly slot his first year he lead the team in yards and didn’t give up that title for the next 2 years. He may look like a linebacker out there at 6’3 225 but don’t be mistaken he is a dominant receiver and solidified it by being named 1st team all SEC his senior year. 
pros: Unbelievable size and speed combination for the position. Immediate impact as a true freshman. Contested catches look east for him. Super physical receiver that can separate last second. No problem handling press with strength. Good speed with the ball in his hands.  Good agility when breaking tackles. Great hands, makes hard catches look like they stick to the gloves effortlessly. 
cons: Should be a better blocker with size. No nuance in his routes, runs them and trusts he’s strong enough to beat the defender. A lot of routes from the slot. 
takeaway: Burks is a super talented receiver that made Arkansa look decent for the first time in a while.  He has the size, speed, and receiving ability to be a true WR 1 and should be coveted highly in this draft. 
WR Wan’Dale Robinson Kentucky 81
info: Robinson was mr Kentucky coming out of Western Hills high school.  Unsurprisingly the Gatorade player of the year in Kentucky was the number one recruit in the state, but surprisingly he choose to go to Nebraska.  He had a solid 2 years for the cornhuskers before transferring to his home state of Kentucky. He immediately became a force in the SEC receiving for over 1000 yards and being named to the 2nd team All SEC team. 
pros: Absolutely menace with the ball, will fight for every available yard. Great ball skills, especially tracking over the shoulder deep balls. Great center of gravity, hard to tackle and can make cuts without losing speed. Good acceleration out of breaks in routes. 
cons: Not the most physically imposing receiver, definitely could struggle with physicality. Used more in a gadget role. Not much outside receiver experience. 
takeaway: Robinson is exactly what he claims his game to be… “electric”. Kentucky was feeding him the ball because he was clearly the best player on the team.  If a team wants to design him targets like they should have with Rondale Moore and Kadarius Toney, he will be a great piece for an offense. 
WR Jahan Dotson Penn St 77
info: Dotson was a 4 star recruit coming out of Nazareth PA and stayed local committing to Penn State.  He immediately hit playing time as a true freshman and continuously got better over the years. He capped his career off with a 90+ reception and 1000+ receiving season.
pros: Great hands, 2 drops on 93 catchable targets. Very good route runner, sets them up very well. Awesome against zone knows how to break them down.  Smooth player, always plays in control.
cons: Not a big or physical receiver at all.  Not much contested catch ability.  Not a plus NFL athlete. Limited due to size and athletic combinations, will have to get by with routes and football IQ. 
takeaway: Jahan Dotson was Penn States clear number one but his skill set won’t translate to. Number one in the NFL. That being said with the way he can run routes and his sure hands he can be a great number 2 which can be very valuable.
WR Drake London USC 93
info: London  could be mistaken for a small forward but the 6’5 210 pound receiver was a dominate force for USC over his career. He had over 500 receiving yards his freshman year and was a big time target for Kedon Slovis in 2020. But his biggest season was his final (although it was cut short due to a fractured ankle) he had over 1k yards and was in the running for the biletnikoff. 
pros: Huge receiver, 6’5 210. Production every year even not as a number 1.  Produced at a young age and was praised by coaches. Unreal contested catch ability, mosses every CB he went against. He is a great X receiver, can play through press get open on a quick slant and attack the sideline.  Great stop start for a guy his size. Physical blocker and isn’t afraid of contact. 
cons: Not a true playmaker with the ball in his hands.  Not a great separator, relies on his physicality and ball skills. 
takeaway: London was the best receiver in college football this year. He is the prototypical X receiver and will immediately step in to be a teams number 1.  He’s the best receiver in the class and it’s by a decent margin.
