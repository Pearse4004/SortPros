WR Drake London USC 90
info: London  could be mistaken for a small forward but the 6’5 210 pound receiver was a dominate force for USC over his career. He had over 500 receiving yards his freshman year and was a big time target for Kedon Slovis in 2020. But his biggest season was his final (although it was cut short due to a fractured ankle) he had over 1k yards and was in the running for the biletnikoff.
pros: Huge receiver, 6’5 210. Production every year even not as a number 1.  Produced at a young age and was praised by coaches. Unreal contested catch ability, mosses every CB he went against. He is a great X receiver, can play through press get open on a quick slant and attack the sideline.  Great stop start for a guy his size. Physical blocker and isn’t afraid of contact.
cons: Not a true playmaker with the ball in his hands.  Not a great separator, relies on his physicality and ball skills.
take: London was the best receiver in college football this year. He is the prototypical X receiver and will immediately step in to be a teams number 1.  He’s the best receiver in the class and it’s by a decent margin.
WR Treylon Burks Arkansas 86
info: Arkansas surprisingly actually kept the top recruit in the state in state.  The 4 star WR out of Warren committed to the razorbacks and immediately was their best WR. Playing mostly slot his first year he lead the team in yards and didn’t give up that title for the next 2 years. He may look like a linebacker out there at 6’3 225 but don’t be mistaken he is a dominant receiver and solidified it by being named 1st team all SEC his senior year.
pros: Unbelievable size and speed combination for the position. Immediate impact as a true freshman. Contested catches look east for him. Super physical receiver that can separate last second. No problem handling press with strength. Good speed with the ball in his hands.  Good agility when breaking tackles. Great hands, makes hard catches look like they stick to the gloves effortlessly.
cons: Should be a better blocker with size. No nuance in his routes, runs them and trusts he’s strong enough to beat the defender. A lot of routes from the slot.
take: Burks is a super talented receiver that made Arkansa look decent for the first time in a while.  He has the size, speed, and receiving ability to be a true WR 1 and should be coveted highly in this draft.
WR Garrett Wilson Ohio State 85
info: Garrett Wilson was a highly recruited 5 star receiver coming out of Lake Travis high school. He decided to attend the power house Ohio State and join a loaded receiving core. The crowded room didn’t effect him as he was clearly a top 2 receiver on the team immediately showing impressive ball skills. He improved each year gaining over 1000 yards in 2021 and being named 2nd team Big 10.
pros: Unbelievable body control. Both a smooth route runner as well as twitchy when he needs to be. YAC ability is there with the ability to make people miss. He floats in the air when attacking a jump ball. Spectacular catches all over his film. Tracks the ball well down the field.
cons: Not top tier speed to burn defenders. Not an overly physical player, can get beaten up with physicality. Too many drops for a top tier WR.
take: Watching Wilson play makes you think it must be nice to be able to move like that. His body control is absurd and has seemed to master 0 gravity which is top tier tools for any wide receiver to have.
WR Jameson Williams Alabama 84
info: Williams was one of the top recruits coming out of Missouri in 2019 and chose the absolute worst place to commit to… Ohiot State.  A lot of the times it was the previous schools fault for not playing a stud like Williams but can you blame them, they had Olave Wilson and Smith Njgba. Williams transferred to Bama his junior year where he proved he was a top receiver in the nation gaining over 1.5k yards. Unfortunately he tore his ACL in the national championship games which caused Bamas offense to come to a halt. This senior season gained him the first team All American nod and a shot at round 1 of the draft.
pros: Super fast, blazes by defenders. Great kick returner. Can sink his hips really well to break off routes. Best deep threat in the class. Has some shake at the line to run past press. Great deep ball tracking.
cons: Coaches valued 3 other receivers over Williams at OSU. One year of production. Slight frame, not much physicality. Change of direction isn’t to the level of his speed. Low contested catch rate as well as some drops.
take: Williams is an absolute burner, possibly the fastest play speed I’ve seen. It was a real shame that he tore his ACL but that shouldn’t take away his ability to blow by defenders at the next level.
WR Skyy Moore Western Michigan 82
info: Moore Has always impressed no matter where he has been. In high school he was a 2 time offensive and defensive player of the year in Allegheny where he played QB. He committed to Western Michigan where he immediately played and was named 1st team All MAC. He finished his career with an amazing season where he had nearly 100 receptions and 1,200+ yards with 11 TDs.
pros: Good measurables, good athletic testing and 10.5 inch hands. Incredible junior season with over 1,200 receiving yards. Showed the ability to win down the sideline with speed and by going up and getting the ball. Super quick and shifty, can shake dudes at the line of scrimmage and break fast at top of routes. Unbelievable over the middle of the field, 99.9 grade on medium routes (Deep slants, In’s, 10 yard outs).
cons: Only had one great year and played at a lower level of competition. Smaller receiver that may get caught up by physical corners. Wont win on jump balls due to size and strength.
take: Western Michigan has produced some top tier WRs now. Moore and Davis have dominated the MAC and should lead them both to 1st round selections despite the fact they played against lower-level competition. Moore Is great at separating with his speed and quickness and is willing to run over the middle and take shots. Worst case scenario he is a good slot receiver in the NFL so he should be coveted highly.
WR Chris Olave Ohio State 82
info: Olave decided to take his talents to Ohio State after a successful career at Mission Hills in California. He was a 3-sport athlete and ran a 10.8 100m in track. He used that speed to attack downfield where he had 15 catches of over 15 yards. He returned for his senior season to pair with another standout receiver Garrett Wilson to form the best duo in college football. His senior season was more of the same after almost reaching 1000 yards and being named first team Big 10.
pros: 1 drop on 51 catchable passes. Sneaky speed, really gets down the field in a hurry with little effort. Not a body catch on tape, all natural hands. Super flexible, can sink hips and change direction great. Had some solid blocks on tape. Showed that he can shake press and create separation. Super smooth player that is always in control.
cons: Not the strongest receiver, can get out muscled. Rounded routes, not much shake to his routes. Not the best with the ball in his hands.
take: Olave is about as good as it gets at the receiver position. He has some of the best hands in college football and is the best deep threat in the class.
WR Jahan Dotson Penn St 80
info: Dotson was a 4 star recruit coming out of Nazareth PA and stayed local committing to Penn State.  He immediately hit playing time as a true freshman and continuously got better over the years. He capped his career off with a 90+ reception and 1000+ receiving season.
pros: Great hands, 2 drops on 93 catchable targets. Very good route runner, sets them up very well. Awesome against zone knows how to break them down.  Smooth player, always plays in control.
cons: Not a big or physical receiver at all.  Not much contested catch ability.  Not a plus NFL athlete. Limited due to size and athletic combinations, will have to get by with routes and football IQ.
take: Jahan Dotson was Penn States clear number one but his skill set won’t translate to. Number one in the NFL. That being said with the way he can run routes and his sure hands he can be a great number 2 which can be very valuable.
WR Wan’Dale Robinson Kentucky 78
info: Robinson was mr Kentucky coming out of Western Hills high school.  Unsurprisingly the Gatorade player of the year in Kentucky was the number one recruit in the state, but surprisingly he choose to go to Nebraska.  He had a solid 2 years for the cornhuskers before transferring to his home state of Kentucky. He immediately became a force in the SEC receiving for over 1000 yards and being named to the 2nd team All SEC team.
pros: Absolutely menace with the ball, will fight for every available yard. Great ball skills, especially tracking over the shoulder deep balls. Great center of gravity, hard to tackle and can make cuts without losing speed. Good acceleration out of breaks in routes.
cons: Not the most physically imposing receiver, definitely could struggle with physicality. Used more in a gadget role. Not much outside receiver experience.
take: Robinson is exactly what he claims his game to be… “electric”. Kentucky was feeding him the ball because he was clearly the best player on the team.  If a team wants to design him targets like they should have with Rondale Moore and Kadarius Toney, he will be a great piece for an offense.
WR John Metchie Alabama 78
info: Metchie was a 4 star recruit coming out of Peddie School in New Jersey. He committed to Alabama and was buried in the loaded WR room with Jeudy, Ruggs, Waddle and Smith. By his second year he was the number 3 option behind Smith and Waddle and had over 900 receiving yards. His junior year he played even better making a lethal WR duo with Williams. He had over 1000 receiving yards before he tore his ACL in the CFP semifinals. He was named to the 2nd team All-SEC by coaches.
pros: Great route runner, makes defenders look silly with routes. Has some good shake to his game, both in routes and with the ball.
cons: Not an elite athlete. Slender frame, Not the best with physicality.
take: Metchie was a very productive and solid receiver for the Tide and should translate to the NFL. He runs great routes and has shown good savvy when running his route which will make him a solid #2 without a trump card.
WR George Pickens Georgia 78
info: Pickens was a top recruit coming out of Hoover in Alabama and went to SEC rival Georgia. He started off with a bang, being named 1st team All-SEC Freshman team and Offensive newcomer of the year. That was the peak of his career unfortunately, He was hurt to start the 2021 season with an ACL and only could play in a few games but helped Georgia win the national championship once he returned.
pros: Good Size and speed at 6’3 4.47. He has 2 career drops and is a solid contested catch option. Good at winning down the field whether that be high pointing or beating his man deep. Solid quickness for 6’3.
cons: Thin frame at under 200 pounds. Injury history, missed an entire season with a knee. Not going to be a weapon with the ball in his hands. Little experience, only 90 career receptions.
take: Pickens looked like he was the next big thing in college football but injuries detracted from his career. He’s a big receiver that can win down the field and produced when he was on the field. A team may get a steal in Pickens if his freshman year was a precursor on whats to come.
WR Christian Watson North Dakota St 77
info: NA
pros: Great makeup, 6’4 208, 10.125 inch hands, ran a 4.36 40 and jumped 38.5 inches. FCS All American as both a return man and receiver in back to back years. Incredible speed, 2nd gear stacks corners easily.
cons: Played against lower level competition. Struggled with drops and not a great contested catch rate. Routes are not good, never going to separate with quickness. Takes a while to throttle down when stopping.
take: Watson is a very special athlete, he jumped out of the stadium and ran a sub 4.4 at 6’4. He hasn’t shown any ability to create separation with routes but he should be able to come in and immediately be a good outside deep threat.
WR Alec Pierce Cincinnati 77
info: NA
pros: Athletic freak, 6’3 over 200 jumping over 40 inches and running a 4.41. Has decent ability to throttle down and make sharp cuts out of his breaks. Plenty of wins down the sideline on his tape.
cons: Never produced like the freak athlete he is in the AAC. Doesn’t explode out of his routes with great burst. Not very quick and wont be making any defenders miss.
take: Pierce is another size and speed receiver that has played pretty well over his career. He never dominated and that’s especially concerning because he was in the AAC but all the tools are there to be a great receiver.
WR David Bell Purdue 75
info: Bell has never had a bad year, coming out of Warren Central he was named the Indiana Gatorade player of the year and male athlete of the year. He stayed local and committed to Purdue where he excelled immediately. He was the Big 10 freshman of the year as well as a Freshman All American after eclipsing 1000 yards receiving. His 2020 year was just as good and was named to the All-Big 10 first team as well as Academic All-Big 10. His senior year he did more of the same with 1,275 yards and another first team All-Big 10 selection.
pros: Good ball skills, great catch where he was falling backwards and still snagged it. Physical receiver, strong and hard to bring down. Produced every year.
cons: No shake to his game, won’t create quick separation. Long speed is average.
take: Bell is a solid receiving prospect that wins with strength and savvy routes. He isn’t a good athlete for the position but that never stopped him from producing. He should be able to contribute to a team’s receiving room immediately.
WR Jalen Tolbert South Alabama 76
info: NA
pros: 2 straight 1000+ receiving yard seasons. Good deep threat, has the speed and length to win down the sideline. Good routes for his size, get out of top of breaks well. Solid athlete all around, has the quickness as well as speed.
cons: 8 drops on the season, hands are inconsistent especially over the middle. Thin frame that can get bullied at the line.
take: Tolbert put together a great career at South Alabama where he was the clear number one and still was getting open. He’s a good athlete that can get open with good routes. He’s too small at this point and will need to add strength to his game to fight through press and contact.
WR Justyn Ross Clemson 76
info: NA
pros: Big Receiver at 6’4 205 pounds. Top recruit and a 1000 yard receiver as a true freshman. Solid 50/50 ball receiver. Runs good routes for a 6’4 receiver.
cons: Struggled with drops over his career until senior year. Had a spinal condition that shut him down for the entire 2020 season. Never played as well as he did as a freshman. Too thin to be a physical receiver. Doesn’t separate well, not much quickness in his game.
take: Ross had a blazing fast start to his career before a spinal injury detracted from his career. He’s a big receiver that’s also a solid athlete with great production as a young player. His senior year wasn’t as dominate because of his lack of suddenness and Clemson offense took a massive step back. If he can get back to his freshman year self a team can get themselves a very good receiver.
WR Khalil Shakir Boise St 73
info: NA
pros: Good athlete. 3 years of solid production capped off by a 1,100 yard season. Has a few spectacular catches on his resume. Makes people miss with the ball in his hands, good change of direction.
cons: 10 drops his senior year most coming over the middle. Short arms at 29 inches. Don’t see much shake in his game, doesn’t have many press releases.
take: Shakir is a tough eval because he doesn’t have much experience against top talent and press. He is a good athlete who is great with the ball in his hands but it’s unknown if he can create separation. He could get lost in a receiving core without the a focus on him.
WR Kevin Austin Notre Dame 74
info: NA
pros: You can tell by looking at him he’s a freak, he’s jacked and a freak athlete. Hes 6’2 200 and all of good weight, he also ran a 4.41 and had great cone numbers. Plays fast, you can see quickness and speed in some of his routes. Has the ability to win with physicality.
cons: One year of 800+ yards and nearly no production past that. Suspended all of 2019. Some routes are run slowed down and a little unsure. Not much press, will have to learn how to beat it.
take: Austin is another physical freak kind of receiver that you wish produced more. He clearly has the ability to be a good receiver now it’s time to see if he will develop and be utilized.
WR Calvin Austin Memphis 70
info: NA
pros: Austin is one of the best athletes in the draft, he ran blazing fast and tested great. Back to back 1000 yard receiving yard seasons. Angle breaking speed, runs right past defenders with ease. Super quick off the line, can beat press like that.
cons: Super small receiver, looks to be a gadget guy. Not good playing through contact, too small. Wasn’t great at getting separation, never set up routes or made them crisp.
take: Austin is what you think he is, an explosive athlete and solid with the ball in his hand. He’s not a refined receiver and will have a hard time at the next level because of his size.
WR Tre Turner Virginia Tech 72
info: NA
pros: 4 years of 500+ yard production. Stacks corners better than you would think. Good body control and is very smooth. Solid quickness off the line.
cons: Poor testing, 8.5 hands, 184 pounds, 27 vert and 7.45 3 cone. Never cracked 700 yards or 5 tds. Weaker receiver, 50/50 may not translate to the NFL. Low end traits, not going to have a trump card.
take: Turner was a very solid WR for the Hookies and didn’t have much of a hole in his game. He doesn’t have a top end trait that he can lean back on and win which will hurt his ceiling. He’s good enough to get in to a receiver rotation but wont be a featured guy.
WR Romeo Doubs Nevada 71
info: Doubs wasn’t a highly recruited player coming out of Jefferson High School in LA, but chose to commit to Nevada because they recruited him hardest. They found a diamond in the rough, by his third season he was a force. He was a 1000 yard receiver the last 2 years as well as a 1st team All-Mountain West receiver.
pros: Good speed to get down the field fast. Great production over his career. Won a good amount of 50/50 balls.
cons: Got exposed at the senior bowl 1v1s. Not a nuanced route runner, a lot of deep routes where he just out runs defender.
take: Doubs had a very good career for Nevada with great deep speed. He went to the senior bowl and didn’t play well which doesn’t translate well to a top receiver. He could be a solid deep threat for a team but never a number 1 or a good separator.
WR Makai Polk Mississippi St 69
info: NA
pros: Lengthy receiver, 6’4 with 32+ inch arms. 1000+ yard receiving yards his final year with 105 receptions. Stops fast and can put a foot in the ground to break on a route. Solid hands, a natural receiver that doesn’t struggle with drops.
cons: Bad testing numbers, ran a 4.6 and a 31 inch vert under 200 lbs. One year of production. Slow, not going to ever threat vertically. No shake to his game, has to win with technique.
take: Polk just isn’t an athlete that can be great in the NFL, he has no traits that separate him. He was good enough his final year to get a shot as a solid 3rd or 4th receiver but he is limited.
WR Velus Jones Tennessee 70
info: NA
pros: Super athlete, ran a 4.31 at 6 foot 204. Great kicker return man, good at finding lanes and making people miss. Can run past anyone down the field.
cons: No receiving production, 800 yards was his best season out of 5. Super old, 25 in the NFL. No nuance to his routes, creates no separation unless its running past someone. Slow off the line, lazy to get to his route.
take: Jones wasn’t a good wide receiver at any point, despite his athleticism he can’t separate. He does have a calling card though, special teams. He was a gunner and return man and with the 4.31 speed that should earn him a roster spot.
WR Dontario Drummond Ole Miss 68
info: NA
pros: 1000 yard receiver his final year. Well built, 6’1 and 215 pounds. Solid with the ball in his hands, breaks arm tackles and can make you miss.
cons: Bad speed, ran a 4.65. Never had to play actual receiver, a lot of slot screen production. Doesn’t have the profile to separate well, never had to.
take: Drummond was an important part of Ole Miss’s offense but it’s not going to translate to the NFL. He won with screens and yac but he’s not very athletic and NFL DBs will stop him easily.
WR Bo Melton Rutgers 75
info: NA
pros: Super athlete, ran a 4.34 with a 38 inch vert. Team captain his last 2 years. Runs really good routes, sells the defenders often. Can make people miss pretty well, lot of screens. Has good quickness as well as the long speed.
cons: On the smaller side, 5’11 189. Has nearly a 10% career drop rate and never had over 700 yards. Played slower than his 40 showed.
take: Melton may have been screwed over by being on Rutgers for so many years. He wasn’t getting many good passes thrown to him but he was consistently cooking his man (especially Northwestern). Melton may be the steal of the draft if he was truly hidden by Rutgers in college.
WR Tyquan Thorton Baylor 73
info: NA
pros: Super fast, ran a 4.28 at the combine with a 10’10 broad. Runs right passed defenders with ease once he’s going. Decently quick for a guy that is that lanky.
cons: He is a twig, 180 at 6’2. 8.25 inch hands. Doesn’t come out of breaks fast at all. Will struggle with physicality.
take: Thorton has wheels, that is for sure. If you don’t play over the top you will not keep up with him. Unfortunately that basically all he excels at, he doesn’t create separation well.
WR Danny Gray SMU 72
info: NA
pros: Great athlete with a 4.33 40 and a 10’6 broad. Quick in and out of breaks. Pretty good with the ball in his hands. Easily runs past defenders.
cons: Drop issue, 7 drops his senior year. A little on the thin side and doesn’t have much strength.
take: Gray didn’t have the greatest career at SMU but he’s a very good athlete. He’s had some nice plays but he has a lot of focus drops and not a physical receiver. If he cleans up his drops he could be a nice piece in a receiving core.
