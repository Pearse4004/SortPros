WR Garrett Wilson Ohio State 85
info: Garrett Wilson was a highly recruited 5 star receiver coming out of Lake Travis high school. He decided to attend the power house Ohio State and join a loaded receiving core. The crowded room didnâ€™t effect him as he was clearly a top 2 receiver on the team immediately showing impressive ball skills. He improved each year gaining over 1000 yards in 2021 and being named 2nd team Big 10.
pros: Unbelievable body control. Both a smooth route runner as well as twitchy when he needs to be. YAC ability is there with the ability to make people miss. He floats in the air when attacking a jump ball. Spectacular catches all over his film. Tracks the ball well down the field.
cons: Not top tier speed to burn defenders. Not an overly physical player, can get beaten up with physicality. Too many drops for a top tier WR.
take: Watching Wilson play makes you think it must be nice to be able to move like that. His body control is absurd and has seemed to master 0 gravity which is top tier tools for any wide receiver to have.
WR Chris Olave Ohio State 86
info: Olave decided to take his talents to Ohio State after a successful career at Mission Hills in California. He was a 3-sport athlete and ran a 10.8 100m in track. He used that speed to attack downfield where he had 15 catches of over 15 yards. He returned for his senior season to pair with another standout receiver Garrett Wilson to form the best duo in college football. His senior season was more of the same after almost reaching 1000 yards and being named first team Big 10.
pros: 1 drop on 51 catchable passes. Sneaky speed, really gets down the field in a hurry with little effort. Not a body catch on tape, all natural hands. Super flexible, can sink hips and change direction great. Had some solid blocks on tape. Showed that he can shake press and create separation. Super smooth player that is always in control.
cons: Not the strongest receiver, can get out muscled. Rounded routes and ran a simple OSU route tree. Not the best with the ball in his hands.
take: Olave is about as good as it gets at the receiver position. He has some of the best hands in college football and is the best deep threat in the class.
