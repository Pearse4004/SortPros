WR Chris Olave Ohio State 87
info: Olave decided to take his talents to Ohio State after a successful career at Mission Hills in California. He was a 3-sport athlete and ran a 10.8 100m in track. He used that speed to attack downfield where he had 15 catches of over 15 yards. He returned for his senior season to pair with another standout receiver Garrett Wilson to form the best duo in college football.
pros: 1 drop on 51 catchable passes. Sneaky speed, really gets down the field in a hurry. Not a body catch on tape, all natural hands. Super flexible, can sink hips and change direction great. Had some solid blocks on tape. Showed that he can shake press and create separation.
cons: Not the strongest receiver, can get out muscled. Rounded routes and ran a simple OSU route tree. Not the best with the ball in his hands.
takeaway: Olave is about as good as it gets at the receiver position. He has some of the best hands in college football and has the movement skills to be an elite route runner.
