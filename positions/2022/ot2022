OT Evan Neal Alabama 91
info: Evan Neal is another monster coming out of the powerhouse high school IMG and committing to the college powerhouse Alabama. He was a 5 star recruit at 6’7 370 which dwarfs everyone standing near him. He immediately stepped in and started at left guard alongside Leatherwood to help Alabama dominate another season and was named a freshman all american. He then moved to right tackle during his second season where he won a national championship. He then moved to Left tackle his final year to protect Bryce Youngs blind side and showed more of the same at LT.
pros: Monster of a build. Moves people in the run game. Long arm, can get on defenders easily. Very easy mover especially for the size. Improved as the 2020 season progressed. Great patience in his pass sets. Great hand usage in the pass game.
cons: Undersets sometimes allowing a speed rush to get by him. On the ground too much in the run game. Feet to close to each other in pass pro when getting a speed rush.
take: Neal has all the size and athleticism to be a great NFL tackle. He has started from day one and has shown a lot of promise to be a great lineman. Although Neal may take a few years to fully develop his ceiling is very high.
OT Nicholas Petit-Frere Ohio St 75
info: Petit-Frere was a top recruit coming of Florida, he was an all American there and even won the OL strength competition as a senior. He was awarded the starting Right tackle role in 2020 where he had a good season only allowing 4 pressures. His 2022 season was not his best where he let up 26 pressures and many of them coming against Hutchinson in the Michigan game.
pros: Solid size for tackle. Really good movement skills. Great zone blocking ability with great foot speed. Aggressive run blocker.
cons: Terrible angle on pass sets. Lets the outside rush up by not getting depth. Turns too fast on pass sets. Not great at hand fighting. Not a great anchor in pass sets.
take: Petit-Frere isn’t a refined product by any means but the size and mobility is there to be successful. He can be a solid flyer to take as a developmental tackle and fill in as a backup when a starter goes down.
