OT Evan Neal Alabama 89
info: Evan Neal is another monster coming out of the powerhouse high school IMG and committing to the college powerhouse Alabama. He was a 5 star recruit at 6’7 370 which dwarfs everyone standing near him. He immediately stepped in and started at left guard alongside Leatherwood to help Alabama dominate another season and was named a freshman all american. He then moved to right tackle during his second season where he won a national championship. He then moved to Left tackle his final year to protect Bryce Youngs blind side and showed more of the same at LT.
pros: Monster of a build. Moves people in the run game. Long arm, can get on defenders easily. Very easy mover especially for the size, great mobility. Improved as the 2020 season progressed. Great patience in his pass sets. Great hand usage in the pass game, punches land and stun defenders.
cons: On the ground too much in the run game. Feet to close to each other in pass pro when getting a speed rush. Has a tough time anchoring for size. Miss reads some stunts and sees stuff late.
take: Neal has all the size and athleticism to be a great NFL tackle. He has started from day one and has shown a lot of promise to be a great lineman. Although Neal may take a few years to fully develop his ceiling is very high.
OT Ikem Ekwonu NC State 88
info: Ikem (which also means “my effort will not be in vain”) stayed local after attending high school in Charlotte NC. Believe it or not he wasn’t even the highest recruited Ekwonu out of that high school. His brother Otisa committed to Notre Dame and Ikem didn’t even get an offer (big time mistake for the Irish). Ikem immediately got playing time for the wolf pack and solidified himself as a top OL in the country with an outstanding senior year where he was named a first team all American.
pros: He graded well as a true freshman. Absolute mauler in the run game. Very aggressive, he will finish every play. Easy mover, pass sets look very smooth and gets to landmarks quick. Great mirror ability.
cons: He’s not the ideal tackle length. Lunges way too much both in the pass and run game. Looks for the kill shot too often. Susceptible to an inside rush because of his feet in pass set.
take: Ekwonu is your classic mauling offensive lineman, he loves getting himself some pancakes. He has all the tools to be a great offensive lineman he just needs to clean up some technique issues and he could be a top lineman in the league.
OT Charles Cross Mississippi St 84
info: Cross was a highly coveted 5 star recruit coming out of Laurel Mississippi. Cross had initially committed to Florida State but switched to Mississippi State to stay closer to home. Cross didn’t get playing time his true freshman year but earned the starting role in his redshirt freshman season. His final season he really showed out and was named 1st team All SEC.
pros: Improved from his 1st to 2nd year as the starting LT. Good potential for a tackle, has the size and movement skills. Does a good job in the run game, moves people and angles them off. Solid mirror skills, guys don’t really blow right by him. Solid at stunt recognition.
cons: Weak anchor, lets guys into his pads and gets walked back. Give the inside rush more than you would like to see. Loves to hold, he essentially holds pretty blatantly on every play. Doesn’t show the dominating power reps (He is still young).
take: Cross has all the upside to be drafted day 1, he played well in the SEC and has the necessary physical ability. He may be a little weak now and needs to clean up some of the stuff that would make him susceptible to power, but given time he could be a good NFL tackle.
OT Trevor Penning Northern Iowa 81
info: Penning has started 2 full seasons for Northern Iowa and if this was baseball he would be accused of steroids. He was a different player his senior year, PFF gave him a 99.9 run blocking grade which is absurd. He was named an All American after his stellar senior season.
pros: Absolute terror in the run game, looking for blood. Upper body strength is very good, can throw them like a rag doll. Good feet in pass pro, always staying in front. Big man at 6’7 320.
cons: He lets people into his pads to easy in pass pro. Played against easy competition most of the time.
take: Penning was a menace playing against lower competition just killing people. He took a step back against Iowa State because they are clearly better players but you can still see the dominance. Once he cleans up his technique he could be one of the best tackles in the NFL.
OT Bernhard Raimann Central Michigan 79
info: Raimann is a very interesting prospect. He is from Austria and was recruited to play for Central Michigan during a foreign exchange program. He went to Central Michigan after fulfilling his military duty so started college as a 20 year old. He initially played Tight End but was move to tackle his junior year. He really showed out in 2021 earning a 94 pff grade.
pros: Only played Tackle for 2 years, lot of room for growth. Fantastic feet in pass set, moves so well and never crosses. Great athlete for a tackle. Good frame that can be filled out.
cons: Only played good one year and he was 24. Isn’t strong enough to step in day one and be a good tackle. Virtually no power in his punch, won’t stun any rushers.
take: Raimann is wildly impressive due to the fact he’s played tackle for 2 years and already has this level of technique down. He has the potential to be great with his frame and movement skills, all that’s left is filling out his frame and adding strength.
OT Jamaree Salyer Georgia 78
info: Salyer was a 5 star recruit coming out of Pace in Georgia and he chose to commit to his home town bulldogs. He became the starting tackle after Andrew Thomas left and was a mainstay for them on the line. His senior year he was named a permanent captain as well as 2nd team All SEC.
pros: Ultra smoot in the pass game. Always in control of himself in pass pro. Good feet in pass pro, can’t get outside him. Great Anchor with a slightly lower center of gravity. Gets hands on defenders and doesn’t let them in on him.
cons: Not much in the run game. Doesn’t come downhill hard nor does he have a quick first step.
take: Salyer would be perfect if all you did is pass, unfortunately that’s not the case. He is ready day one to step in and be a solid pass protector but his run blocking leaves a lot to be desired.
OT Daniel Faalele Minnesota 77
info: Faalele is relatively new to football, he came to America 5 years ago and went to IMG for high school. The Melbourne native was recruited to play there because of his massive size being close to 400 pounds. He committed to Minnesota where he was an immediate starter and played alright. He took another leap forward this year as he was named captain and first team all Big 10.
pros: Monster of a human at 6’9 380. Moves incredibly well for his size. Easily moves people in the run game. Can mirror well. Long arm that can engulf defenders.
cons: He lets defenders into his pads too easily. Plays super high as he pops up out of his stance.
take: Faalele isn’t someone you find too often, people just don’t move like that at this size. He’s like if Orlando Brown could move at all which should allow him to be a starter immediately and a future all pro.
OT Darian Kinnard Kentucky 77
info: Kinnard was a 4 star recruit coming out of St Ignatius in Ohio. The 6’5 350 pound OL committed to Kentucky where he played as a true freshman. He got the starting job late his freshman year and never let it go. He graded unbelievably well for the next three years and was named 1st team All SEC
pros: Big frame, Carries 350 pretty well. Great run blocker, positions himself well and can drive defenders. Good anchor in the pass game. Strong hands, doesn’t let people out of his grip.
cons: Slow feet, he can get holding because he can’t stay in front. Narrow feet in pass set because he’s slow to get set.
take: Kinnard is a big man who played well in the SEC for 3 straight years. He has the power that is needed for the NFL but will need to find a way to make up for his slow feet.
OT Tyler Smith Tulsa 77
info: NA

cons: 16 penalties his senior year, way too much. LOVES to hold on every play. Feet in pass pro needs a lot of work. Plays super high too often. Doesn’t look like he’s ever learned to play tackle.
take: Smith is a total project at tackle, if he were to play right now, he would get 8 holding calls and 10 pressures given up. But, he has all the tools you could want and played well at Tulsa so there is a lot to work with.
OT Abraham Lucas Washington St 76
info: Lucas is a 5th year senior who was named to the first team All PAC 12 team. He’s one of the best pass blockers in the country and he had a lot of opportunities to do so in a pass heavy Washington State offense.
pros: Fantastic in the pass game, awesome sets he’s always in control. Good use of hands in the pass game.
cons: He’s not very good in the run game at moving anyone. Not the best athlete so has a hard time cutting off DL.
take: Lucas is a superb pass blocker, if your looking for a pass blocking RT he’s your guy and could play right away. That being said he has his limitations especially in the run game which should drop him down boards.
OT Max Mitchell Louisiana 76
info: Mitchell wasn’t a big time recruit coming out of Neville in Louisiana. He joined the Ragin Cajuns in 2018 and got the starting spot in 2019.

pros: Good athlete, 4.9 40 and 33 inch vert. 92 PFF pass grade his final year and improved every year. Played both tackle and center. Easy mover, mirrors edge rushers with ease. Solid base, doesn’t get his feet too narrow.
cons: Smaller side at 6’4 304. Not great in the run game, no real movement created.
take: Tom is underrated, he’s a silky-smooth pass protector that uses his hands well. He doesn’t have the ideal size or strength but he’s a great athlete that is a good pass protector.
OT Luke Goedeke Central Michigan 75
info: Goedeke took a longer road than most, he got hurt his senior year and had to walk on to play tight end at University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point. He drew attention from 2 programs, Wisconsin for a walk on spot and Central Michigan on a scholarship. He went to Central Michigan and made the switch to Tackle. He played opposite of Raimann forming a great tackle duo for the team.
pros: Plays with great strength in both run and pass game. Really good in the run game at cutting off angles and over powering DL. Moves well for the size, the tight end skills translated.
cons: Plays a little high in pass sets. Lets defenders get into his pads to easy in pass pro.
take: Goedeke has had a long journey to get to the NFL. He has the tools to play at the next level and has shown that he is a great run blocker. If he can clean up his pass sets he will be a good tackle

info: NA
pros: Got a 90 PFF run blocking grade in 2020. Ran a sub 5 second 40. Great feet and mirroring ability, easy mover in pass pro. Aggressive run blocker, really tries to move defenders.
cons: Played against lower-level pass rushers, not top competition. Has some issues dealing with strength in pass pro.

pros: Solid size for tackle. Really good movement skills. Great zone blocking ability with great foot speed. Aggressive run blocker.
cons: Terrible angle on pass sets. Lets the outside rush up by not getting depth. Turns too fast on pass sets. Not great at hand fighting. Not a great anchor in pass sets.
take: Petit-Frere isn’t a refined product by any means but the size and mobility is there to be successful. He can be a solid flyer to take as a developmental tackle and fill in as a backup when a starter goes down.
OT Joshua Ezeudu North Carolina 74
info: NA
pros: Good length, 34 inch arms. Played both LT and LG. Solid athlete, many downfield blocks on his tape. Can create movement in the run game by running his feet. Good mirroring skills and get hands on defenders well.
cons: 7 penalties his senior year. Played worse at guard than he did tackle. A little thin at 309 pounds, could struggle with power rush. Hands get wide in pass pro and can get off balance.
take: Ezeudu was on a struggling North Carolina offensive line, but he was not the issue. He has the Length and athleticism to be an NFL tackle but needs to add more power to his game.
OT Obinna Eze TCU 72
info: NA
pros: Made in a lab, 6’6.5 320 pounds with an absurd 36 inch arm length. 3 years of starting experience with good pass blocking grades. Isn’t a bad linear athlete, can get off the line pretty well. Pretty good anchor and power in the run game.
cons: Can’t change direction at all, 8+ 3 cone drill. Needs to completely overhaul his pass sets. His feet are beyond sloppy, random steps and kicks in pass pro.
take: Eze is your prototypical developmental tackle, he has played ok but has all the measurables to be a starting tackle. He needs to completely relearn his technique but he could be a valuable player for a team down the line.
OT Sean Rhyan UCLA 73
info: NA
pros: Young, 3 year starter at UCLA. Solid Size, 6’5 320 and 11-inch hands with a 33 inch vert. Improved in PFF grade each year. Good pass pro sets, smooth and able to pick up stunts. Good power when latched on to defender.
cons: 32 3/8 inch arms so a little smaller than you would like. Slow feet, can get beat to the outside too easily. Tough reach blocks and open field blocks because of his footspeed.
take: Rhyan has had a solid career at UCLA playing for his first 3 years at LT. He’s a big lineman that is a smooth player with power behind him. He should be moved to guard in the NFL because of his lack of footspeed because speed rushers would eat him up.
OT Spencer Buford UTSA 73
info: Buford was one of the best recruits UTSA has ever gotten, he was a 4 star coming out of San Antonio. He immediately became the starting LT for them and was a top player for them as well.

cons: Rough feet in pass sets, get too close together. Hands to high on punches in pass pro. Leans forward too much in pass pro.

cons: No strength. 285 pound lineman, needs to put on weight.
take: Parham has potential, he was a former tight end and is a great athlete. He doesn’t have the size or play strength to see an NFL field as of right now and he’s a red shirt senior.
OT Ja’Tyre Carter Southern University 72
info: There’s not a lot of information on Carter but he was one of the best tackles in the SWAC. He was invited to the senior bowl because of his great career at Southern.
pros: Super low and smooth pass pro out of stance. Good power in the run game for the SWAC.
cons: No real competition played, not sure if he can hold up to any power.
take: Carter was a very good player in the SWAC and is very good in pass pro. It will be tough to translate to the NFL with his smaller size but he could possibly turn into a solid tackle.

cons: Not a quick player, he can lose on the first step too often. His pad level is not good with his height. Has to lunge a little too much and gets beat.
take: Stueber was a very good player for Michigan, with the size he has and the ability to move he should be drafted. He doesn’t play as in control as you would like but he definitely has the talent to play in the NFL.

cons: Plays high which allows defenders under his pads to bull rush him. Not very flexible nor a good athlete. Doesn’t keep defenders off his body by getting hands on.

take: Bruss is an unathletic lineman but he has been solid for the badgers for the past 3 years. He will have a hard time blocking NFL lineman but he’s worth a shot.
OT Chris Paul Tulsa 67

pros: He’s a strong player when he gets hands on him.
cons: Very inflexible, high hips in stance. Not a fluid athlete especially in pass pro. Loves to hold because he can’t recover.

cons: The worst athlete ever, couldn’t even broad jump 100 inches. Plays super high and very slow. His feet are terrible, no speed in them and plays with a bad base.

pros: Played well against high schoolers.
cons: Didn’t show out at the combine. Just didn’t dominate like he needed to in his lower level of competition.
