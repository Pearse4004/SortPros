OT Evan Neal Alabama 91
info: Evan Neal is another monster coming out of the powerhouse high school IMG and committing to the college powerhouse Alabama. He was a 5 star recruit at 6â€™7 370 which dwarfs everyone standing near him. He immediately stepped in and started at left guard alongside Leatherwood to help Alabama dominate another season and was named a freshman all american. He then moved to right tackle during his second season where he won a national championship. He then moved to Left tackle his final year to protect Bryce Youngs blind side and showed more of the same at LT.
pros: Monster of a build. Moves people in the run game. Long arm, can get on defenders easily. Very easy mover especially for the size. Improved as the 2020 season progressed. Great patience in his pass sets. Great hand usage in the pass game.
cons: Undersets sometimes allowing a speed rush to get by him. On the ground too much in the run game. Feet to close to each other in pass pro when getting a speed rush.
take: Neal has all the size and athleticism to be a great NFL tackle. He has started from day one and has shown a lot of promise to be a great lineman. Although Neal may take a few years to fully develop his ceiling is very high.
