OT Evan Neal Alabama 88
info: Evan Neal is another monster coming out of the powerhouse high school IMG and committing to the college powerhouse Alabama. He was a 5 star recruit at 6’7 370 which dwarfs everyone standing near him. He immediately stepped in and started at left guard alongside Leatherwood to help Alabama dominate another season and was named a freshman all american. He then moved to right tackle during his second season where he won a national championship. He then moved to Left tackle his final year to protect Bryce Youngs blind side and showed more of the same at LT.
pros: Monster of a build. Moves people in the run game. Long arm, can get on defenders easily. Very easy mover especially for the size, great mobility. Improved as the 2020 season progressed. Great patience in his pass sets. Great hand usage in the pass game, punches land and stun defenders.
cons: On the ground too much in the run game. Feet to close to each other in pass pro when getting a speed rush. Has a tough time anchoring for size. Miss reads some stunts and sees stuff late.
take: Neal has all the size and athleticism to be a great NFL tackle. He has started from day one and has shown a lot of promise to be a great lineman. Although Neal may take a few years to fully develop his ceiling is very high.
OT Nicholas Petit-Frere Ohio St 74
info: Petit-Frere was a top recruit coming of Florida, he was an all American there and even won the OL strength competition as a senior. He was awarded the starting Right tackle role in 2020 where he had a good season only allowing 4 pressures. His 2022 season was not his best where he let up 26 pressures and many of them coming against Hutchinson in the Michigan game.
pros: Solid size for tackle. Really good movement skills. Great zone blocking ability with great foot speed. Aggressive run blocker.
cons: Terrible angle on pass sets. Lets the outside rush up by not getting depth. Turns too fast on pass sets. Not great at hand fighting. Not a great anchor in pass sets.
take: Petit-Frere isn’t a refined product by any means but the size and mobility is there to be successful. He can be a solid flyer to take as a developmental tackle and fill in as a backup when a starter goes down.
OT Ikem Ekwonu NC State 87
info: Ikem (which also means “my effort will not be in vain”) stayed local after attending high school in Charlotte NC. Believe it or not he wasn’t even the highest recruited Ekwonu out of that high school. His brother Otisa committed to Notre Dame and Ikem didn’t even get an offer (big time mistake for the Irish). Ikem immediately got playing time for the wolf pack and solidified himself as a top OL in the country with an outstanding senior year where he was named a first team all American.
pros: He graded well as a true freshman. Absolute mauler in the run game. Very aggressive, he will finish every play. Easy mover, pass sets look very smooth and gets to landmarks quick. Great mirror ability.
cons: He’s not the ideal tackle length. Lunges way too much both in the pass and run game. Looks for the kill shot too often. Susceptible to an inside rush because of his feet in pass set.
take: Ekwonu is your classic mauling offensive lineman, he loves getting himself some pancakes. He has all the tools to be a great offensive lineman he just needs to clean up some technique issues and he could be a top lineman in the league.
OT Charles Cross Mississippi St 79
info: Cross was a highly coveted 5 star recruit coming out of Laurel Mississippi. Cross had initially committed to Florida State but switched to Mississippi State to stay closer to home. Cross didn’t get playing time his true freshman year but earned the starting role in his redshirt freshman season. His final season he really showed out and was named 1st team All SEC.
pros: Improved from his 1st to 2nd year as the starting LT. Good potential for a tackle, has the size and movement skills. Does a good job in the run game, moves people and angles them off. Solid mirror skills, guys don’t really blow right by him. Solid at stunt recognition.
cons: Weak anchor, lets guys into his pads and gets walked back. Give the inside rush more than you would like to see. Loves to hold, he essentially holds pretty blatantly on every play. Doesn’t show the dominating power reps (He is still young).
take: Cross has all the upside to be drafted day 1, he played well in the SEC and has the necessary physical ability. He may be a little weak now and needs to clean up some of the stuff that would make him susceptible to power, but given time he could be a good NFL tackle.
OT Bernhard Raimann Central Michigan 84
info: Raimann is a very interesting prospect. He is from Austria and was recruited to play for Central Michigan during a foreign exchange program. He went to Central Michigan after fulfilling his military duty so started college as a 20 year old. He initially played Tight End but was move to tackle his junior year. He really showed out in 2021 earning a 94 pff grade. 
pros: Only played Tackle for 2 years, lot of room for growth. Fantastic feet in pass set, moves so well and never crosses. Great athlete for a tackle. Good frame that can be filled out.
cons: Only played good one year and he was 24. Isn’t strong enough to step in day one and be a good tackle. Virtually no power in his punch, won’t stun any rushers.
take: Raimann is wildly impressive due to the fact he’s played tackle for 2 years and already has this level of technique down. He has the potential to be great with his frame and movement skills, all that’s left is filling out his frame and adding strength. 
OT Nick Zakelj Fordham 73
info: Zakelj was a menace for Fordham after he started playing in 2018. His second year he already was named All Patriot League first team. He was a captain and one of the best players on his team and he sure looked the part of a star tackle.
pros: He has bad intentions in the run game, he wants to burry defenders. Has good size and movement skills.
cons: Plays off balance too much, gets thrown around when defenders gets hands on him. Although he has good movement skills he allows people to the outside to easily.
take: Zakelj was clearly the best player on Fordham but with that being said it’s not a huge accomplishment. He has the physical ability to play in the NFL but some reps in the Nebraska game showed why he may not be ready to play immediately.
OT Andrew Stueber Michigan 71
info: Stueber was a monster coming out of Connecticut and was a top recruit from the state. He didn’t play early partially due to an injury in 2019. He started his final 2 years and coaches loved him, he was a hard working linemane that gained respect around the conference. He was named 1st team Big 10 by coaches and a second team All American by coaches as well. The media didn’t give him much love but the football guys knew how good he was.
pros: Big man who can move, 6’7 330 and carries the weight well. When he gets a hold of a defender it’s game over. Solid in pass protection, good at staying in front of the defender.
cons: Not a quick player, he can lose on the first step too often. His pad level is not good with his height. Has to lunge a little too much and gets beat.
take: Stueber was a very good player for Michigan, with the size he has and the ability to move he should be drafted. He doesn’t play as in control as you would like but he definitely has the talent to play in the NFL.
OT Daniel Faalele Minnesota 80
info: Faalele is relatively new to football, he came to America 5 years ago and went to IMG for high school. The Melbourne native was recruited to play there because of his massive size being close to 400 pounds. He committed to Minnesota where he was an immediate starter and played alright. He took another leap forward this year as he was named captain and first team all Big 10.
pros: Monster of a human at 6’9 380. Moves incredibly well for his size. Easily moves people in the run game. Can mirror well. Long arm that can engulf defenders.
cons: He lets defenders into his pads too easily. Plays super high as he pops up out of his stance.
take: Faalele isn’t someone you find too often, people just don’t move like that at this size. He’s like if Orlando Brown could move at all which should allow him to be a starter immediately and a future all pro.
OT Matt Waletzko North Dakota 68
info: Waletzko was a 4 year starter for North Dakota and a solid player for them. He was named to the All FCS team after a very good senior year.
pros: Lands good punches in pass pro, keeps his hand in tight. Smooth in pass pro and doesn’t lose to speed. Good height/length at 6’7.
cons: He plays off balance in both pass and run game he stumbles often. Not much strength, he’s light for the position. Doesn’t move people in the run game.
take: Waletzko could get away with his build in the FCS and did quite effectively but it wont pass in the NFL. He needs to add some mass then he could be an NFL tackle.
OT Trevor Penning Northern Iowa 82
info: Penning has started 2 full seasons for Northern Iowa and if this was baseball he would be accused of steroids. He was a different player his senior year, PFF gave him a 99.9 run blocking grade which is absurd. He was named an All American after his stellar senior season.
pros: Absolute terror in the run game, looking for blood. Upper body strength is very good, can throw them like a rag doll. Good feet in pass pro, always staying in front. Big man at 6’7 320.
cons: He lets people into his pads to easy in pass pro. Played against easy competition most of the time.
take: Penning was a menace playing against lower competition just killing people. He took a step back against Iowa State because they are clearly better players but you can still see the dominance. Once he cleans up his technique he could be one of the best tackles in the NFL.
OT Abraham Lucas Washington St 75
info: Lucas is a 5th year senior who was named to the first team All PAC 12 team. He’s one of the best pass blockers in the country and he had a lot of opportunities to do so in a pass heavy Washington State offense.
pros: Fantastic in the pass game, awesome sets he’s always in control. Good use of hands in the pass game.
cons: He’s not very good in the run game at moving anyone. Not the best athlete so has a hard time cutting off DL.
take: Lucas is a superb pass blocker, if your looking for a pass blocking RT he’s your guy and could play right away. That being said he has his limitations especially in the run game which should drop him down boards.
OT Luke Goedeke Central Michigan 75
info: Goedeke took a longer road than most, he got hurt his senior year and had to walk on to play tight end at University of Wisconsin - Stevens Point. He drew attention from 2 programs, Wisconsin for a walk on spot and Central Michigan on a scholarship. He went to Central Michigan and made the switch to Tackle. He played opposite of Raimann forming a great tackle duo for the team.
pros: Plays with great strength in both run and pass game. Really good in the run game at cutting off angles and over powering DL. Moves well for the size, the tight end skills translated.
cons: Plays a little high in pass sets. Lets defenders get into his pads to easy in pass pro.
take: Goedeke has had a long journey to get to the NFL. He has the tools to play at the next level and has shown that he is a great run blocker. If he can clean up his pass sets he will be a good tackle
OT Ja’Tyre Carter Southern University 71
info: There’s not a lot of information on Carter but he was one of the best tackles in the SWAC. He was invited to the senior bowl because of his great career at Southern.
pros: Super low and smooth pass pro out of stance. Good power in the run game for the SWAC.
cons: No real competition played, not sure if he can hold up to any power.
take: Carter was a very good player in the SWAC and is very good in pass pro. It will be tough to translate to the NFL with his smaller size but he could possibly turn into a solid tackle.
OT Jamaree Salyer Georgia 77
info: Salyer was a 5 star recruit coming out of Pace in Georgia and he chose to commit to his home town bulldogs. He became the starting tackle after Andrew Thomas left and was a mainstay for them on the line. His senior year he was named a permanent captain as well as 2nd team All SEC.
pros: Ultra smoot in the pass game. Always in control of himself in pass pro. Good feet in pass pro, can’t get outside him. Great Anchor with a slightly lower center of gravity. Gets hands on defenders and doesn’t let them in on him.
cons: Not much in the run game. Doesn’t come downhill hard nor does he have a quick first step.
take: Salyer would be perfect if all you did is pass, unfortunately that’s not the case. He is ready day one to step in and be a solid pass protector but his run blocking leaves a lot to be desired.
OT Darian Kinnard Kentucky 76
info: Kinnard was a 4 star recruit coming out of St Ignatius in Ohio. The 6’5 350 pound OL committed to Kentucky where he played as a true freshman. He got the starting job late his freshman year and never let it go. He graded unbelievably well for the next three years and was named 1st team All SEC
pros: Big frame, Carries 350 pretty well. Great run blocker, positions himself well and can drive defenders. Good anchor in the pass game. Strong hands, doesn’t let people out of his grip.
cons: Slow feet, he can get holding because he can’t stay in front. Narrow feet in pass set because he’s slow to get set.
take: Kinnard is a big man who played well in the SEC for 3 straight years. He has the power that is needed for the NFL but will need to find a way to make up for his slow feet.
OT Max Mitchell Louisiana 83
info: Mitchell wasn’t a big time recruit coming out of Neville in Louisiana. He joined the Ragin Cajuns in 2018 and got the starting spot in 2019. He immediately played well and never had a season below 80 and an outstanding 94 grade in 2021. He was named an All American for his dominate senior season.
pros: Great pass sets, excellent at mirroring and getting to his landmarks in a hurray. Great at getting his body in the way on zone runs and walling off. Fires his hands well and latches on to defenders. Good athlete, moves very well.
cons: He doesn’t have dominating strength, he won’t impress with run blocks by throwing dudes.
take: Mitchell had a fantastic 2021 season and he even looked good against competition like Texas. He has the strength and athleticism to play right now and be a solid starting tackle.
OT Dylan Parham Memphis 68
info: Parham was a tight end and a track star before going to Memphis. He redshirted his 1st year and then became a starter on the OL the next year. He started at RG, LT and LG for Memphis and was named first team All AAC.
pros: Great movement skills. Blocks in open space great. Gets to landmarks fast. Can seal off zone blocks well.
cons: No strength. 285 pound lineman, needs to put on weight.
take: Parham has potential, he was a former tight end and is a great athlete. He doesn’t have the size or play strength to see an NFL field as of right now and he’s a red shirt senior.
OT Braxton Jones Southern Utah 71
info: Jones wasn’t recruited heavily out of Murray Utah so he attended Southern Utah. He started out on defense but by his Junior year he was their starting tackle. His next two season he played great and was named an FCS All American. And to top it all off he is a Ravens fan.
pros: Good Height at 6’7. Solid play strength, can move guys in the run game. Good athlete, quick feet and gets to landmarks.
cons: Plays really high, constantly getting out leveraged. Hard time getting hands on rushers.
take: Jones looks the part although he played against low level competition. If a team can get him to play with better leverage he could be an NFL starter.
OT Cade Mays Tennessee 73
info: Mays was a stud 5 star recruit coming out of Tennessee. His father was a captain at Tennessee and his brother was a guard there as well. Surprisingly he chose to go to Georgia where he got playing time. After 2 years he transferred to his hometown Vols and was a starter there for the rest of his career. He was named to the 2nd All SEC team his senior year to cap off a solid college career.
pros: Great size at 6’6 325. Very aggressive in the run game, will move DL off their spots. Solid pass sets, balanced and doesn’t get ran around easy.
cons: Plays high which allows defenders under his pads to bull rush him. Not very flexible nor a good athlete. Doesn’t keep defenders off his body by getting hands on.
take: Mays had a lot of high hopes as a top recruit and an early contributor but he never could dominate. He’s limited physically but he could still server as a starter in the NFL at some point with more coaching.
OT Chris Paul Tulsa 66
info: Paul is an interesting guy, he was born in Nigeria and is much more than a football player. He loves to produce music and is working on his MBA after getting his degree in computer information systems. He started for Tulsa in 2018 and beyond where he was a staple on the OL.
pros: He’s a strong player when he gets hands on him.
cons: Very inflexible, high hips in stance. Not a fluid athlete especially in pass pro. Loves to hold because he can’t recover.
take: Paul isn’t good enough to play in the NFL. Ohio State took him apart and it will only get worse.
OT Spencer Buford UTSA 72
info: Buford was one of the best recruits UTSA has ever gotten, he was a 4 star coming out of San Antonio. He immediately became the starting LT for them and was a top player for them as well.
pros: Good athlete, moves very well. Great puller, throws nasty blocks on impact. Solid play strength for the size.
cons: Rough feet in pass sets, get too close together. Hands to high on punches in pass pro. Leans forward too much in pass pro.
take: It’s surprising Buford didn’t get more looks coming out of high school. He’s a solid athlete with good play strength and with coaching could be a solid NFL player.
