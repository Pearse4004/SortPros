OT Evan Neal Alabama 87
info: Evan Neal is another monster coming out of the powerhouse high school IMG and committing to the college powerhouse Alabama. He was a 5 star recruit at 6’7 370 which dwarfs everyone standing near him. He immediately stepped in and started at left guard alongside Leatherwood to help Alabama dominate another season and was named a freshman all american. He then moved to right tackle during his second season where he won a national championship. He then moved to Left tackle his final year to protect Bryce Youngs blind side and showed more of the same at LT.
pros: Monster of a build. Moves people in the run game. Long arm, can get on defenders easily. Very easy mover especially for the size, great mobility. Improved as the 2020 season progressed. Great patience in his pass sets. Great hand usage in the pass game, punches land and stun defenders.
cons: On the ground too much in the run game. Feet to close to each other in pass pro when getting a speed rush. Has a tough time anchoring for size. Miss reads some stunts and sees stuff late.
take: Neal has all the size and athleticism to be a great NFL tackle. He has started from day one and has shown a lot of promise to be a great lineman. Although Neal may take a few years to fully develop his ceiling is very high.
OT Nicholas Petit-Frere Ohio St 74
info: Petit-Frere was a top recruit coming of Florida, he was an all American there and even won the OL strength competition as a senior. He was awarded the starting Right tackle role in 2020 where he had a good season only allowing 4 pressures. His 2022 season was not his best where he let up 26 pressures and many of them coming against Hutchinson in the Michigan game.
pros: Solid size for tackle. Really good movement skills. Great zone blocking ability with great foot speed. Aggressive run blocker.
cons: Terrible angle on pass sets. Lets the outside rush up by not getting depth. Turns too fast on pass sets. Not great at hand fighting. Not a great anchor in pass sets.
take: Petit-Frere isn’t a refined product by any means but the size and mobility is there to be successful. He can be a solid flyer to take as a developmental tackle and fill in as a backup when a starter goes down.
OT Ikem Ekwonu NC State 86
info: Ikem (which also means “my effort will not be in vain”) stayed local after attending high school in Charlotte NC. Believe it or not he wasn’t even the highest recruited Ekwonu out of that high school. His brother Otisa committed to Notre Dame and Ikem didn’t even get an offer (big time mistake for the Irish). Ikem immediately got playing time for the wolf pack and solidified himself as a top OL in the country with an outstanding senior year where he was named a first team all American.
pros: He graded well as a true freshman. Absolute mauler in the run game. Very aggressive, he will finish every play. Easy mover, pass sets look very smooth and gets to landmarks quick. Great mirror ability.
cons: He’s not the ideal tackle length. Lunges way too much both in the pass and run game. Looks for the kill shot too often. Susceptible to an inside rush because of his feet in pass set.
take: Ekwonu is your classic mauling offensive lineman, he loves getting himself some pancakes. He has all the tools to be a great offensive lineman he just needs to clean up some technique issues and he could be a top lineman in the league.
OT Charles Cross Mississippi St 79
info: Cross was a highly coveted 5 star recruit coming out of Laurel Mississippi. Cross had initially committed to Florida State but switched to Mississippi State to stay closer to home. Cross didn’t get playing time his true freshman year but earned the starting role in his redshirt freshman season. His final season he really showed out and was named 1st team All SEC.
pros: Improved from his 1st to 2nd year as the starting LT. Good potential for a tackle, has the size and movement skills. Does a good job in the run game, moves people and angles them off. Solid mirror skills, guys don’t really blow right by him. Solid at stunt recognition.
cons: Weak anchor, lets guys into his pads and gets walked back. Give the inside rush more than you would like to see. Loves to hold, he essentially holds pretty blatantly on every play. Doesn’t show the dominating power reps (He is still young).
take: Cross has all the upside to be drafted day 1, he played well in the SEC and has the necessary physical ability. He may be a little weak now and needs to clean up some of the stuff that would make him susceptible to power, but given time he could be a good NFL tackle.
OT Bernhard Raimann Central Michigan 80
info: Raimann is a very interesting prospect. He is from Austria and was recruited to play for Central Michigan during a foreign exchange program. He went to Central Michigan after fulfilling his military duty so started college as a 20 year old. He initially played Tight End but was move to tackle his junior year. He really showed out in 2021 earning a 94 pff grade. 
pros: Only played Tackle for 2 years, lot of room for growth. Fantastic feet in pass set, moves so well and never crosses. Great athlete for a tackle. Good frame that can be filled out.
cons: Only played good one year and he was 24. Isn’t strong enough to step in day one and be a good tackle. Virtually no power in his punch, won’t stun any rushers.
take: Raimann is wildly impressive due to the fact he’s played tackle for 2 years and already has this level of technique down. He has the potential to be great with his frame and movement skills, all that’s left is filling out his frame and adding strength.
