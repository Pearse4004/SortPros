CB Derek Stingley LSU 87
info: Stingley stayed in his hometown after a dominating high school career where he ended up as one of the highest rated CB recruits of all time. He was named the Gatorade Louisiana Player of the year and he stepped right into the LSU starting lineup. He had an impressive freshman campaign where he won a national championship, had 6 picks and was a first team All-American. He dropped off a bit in 2020 and dealt with some injuries but still had a good season.
pros: 19 as of 5/9/2021, Good size and speed combo for the position. Best at playing the ball I have seen. Great makeup speed to shut down go balls. Breaks on routes well. Has a lot of man experience playing at LSU.
cons: Probably still having nightmares about Devonta Smith. Looked like a worse player in 2020 and 2021. Opens hips to easily when given a fake, Van Jefferson got him multiple times. Not very fluid in open space, didn’t look great in zone. Not a very physical corner.
take: Stingley really showed his skills his freshman year and vaulted his name into the first round immediately. He regressed in 2020 a little bit and has been exposed by elite route runners. He has the size and athleticism to be a shut down corner in a man heavy scheme.
CB Demario McCall Ohio St 65
info: One of the top recruits in Ohio out of North Ridgeville high school committed to the buckeyes as a running back. He had a hard time getting playing time due to the loaded roster he was joining. Early in his career he got some reps late in games and produced a little. As a senior he decided to join the defensive side of the ball but still didn’t get playing time. Overall it was a disappointing career at Ohio State for the former 4 star recruit.
pros: Position Versatility. Good athlete, quick on his feet.
cons: Never got real playing time. Small, 5/9 180.
take: McCall is a good athlete but never could crack the starting lineup. Could be an interesting camp body.
CB Marcus Williamson Ohio St 67
info: Williamson was another 4 star product coming out of IMG academy as a top corner back in the class. He had trouble seeing the field early do to injuries but from 2020 and on he was a consistent starter for the buckeyes secondary.
pros: A quick and twitchy athlete. Willing to play physical and run into the box.
cons: Didn’t make many plays on the ball. Small, 5’10, 190. Looked into the backfield instead of feeling routes behind him too much.
take: Williamson was a slot only player for the buckeyes do to his size. He was a very willing player when it came to contact but was to small to play through it. He should be on a training camp roster.
CB Sevyn Banks Ohio St 68
info: Banks was the typical story for Ohio State. He was a 4 star recruit out of Jones Highschool in Orlando and was waiting his turn to break out after Okudah and Arnett were drafted. Unfortunately that wasn’t the case as he only played in the final 4 games of the season.
pros: Good size, 6’1 200 lbs. Very safe deep player, won’t bite on eye candy in front of him.
cons: Couldn’t get on the field his senior season. Plays with no urgency. Not a good tackler. Seems to be a cover 3/2 only player.
take: Sevyn had high hopes that he never could live up to. He isn’t much of a playmaker nor a good run support player which won’t translate to any level of football. He should be a guy to get into camp given his experience and size though.
CB Sauce Gardener Cincinnati 91
info: Sauce got his nickname all the way back in his pop warner days by his coach. He was called this because he was an elusive running back, but his real calling was at cornerback. He moved there his junior year of high school and was recruited to Cincinnati to be their lock down corner.  He very much so did that, he stepped in immediately and played great as a freshman. But his final year was special, he locked down every WR he went up against. 
pros: Sticky in man coverage, always in the hip pocket. Great size fir the position. Good athlete, great acceleration. Very patient when playing press, doesn’t commit too early. Willing in the run game, sheds blocks pretty well. 
cons: He’s not a strong tackler, slight frame. Only few games against top tier guys. 
take: Gardener is the best man corner back out of college I’ve ever seen. His ability to stay with receivers and press them is 2nd to none. He can immediately start and be a good NFL corner.
