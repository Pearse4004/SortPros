CB Derek Stingley LSU 86
info: Stingley stayed in his hometown after a dominating high school career where he ended up as one of the highest rated CB recruits of all time. He was named the Gatorade Louisiana Player of the year and he stepped right into the LSU starting lineup. He had an impressive freshman campaign where he won a national championship, had 6 picks and was a first team All-American. He dropped off a bit in 2020 and dealt with some injuries but still had a good season.
pros: 19 as of 5/9/2021, Good size and speed combo for the position. Best at playing the ball I have seen. Great makeup speed to shut down go balls. Breaks on routes well. Has a lot of man experience playing at LSU.
cons: Probably still having nightmares about Devonta Smith. Looked like a worse player in 2020. Opens hips to easily when given a fake, Van Jefferson got him multiple times. Not very fluid in open space, didnâ€™t look great in zone. Not a very physical corner.
takeaway: Stingley really showed his skills his freshman year and vaulted his name into the first round immediately. He regressed in 2020 a little bit and has been exposed by elite route runners. He has the size and athleticism to be a shut down corner in a man heavy scheme.
