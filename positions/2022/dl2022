DL Devonte Wyatt Georgia 85
info: Wyatt was a 4 star prospect coming from Decatur Georgia but he didn’t have the grades to make it to Georgia straight out of High School. He went the JUCO route at Hutchinson CC and raised his grades to make him eligible for the NCAA. He was a contributor his first two years at Georgia before coming a full time starter his Junior year. He lead the interior DL in tackles his junior year but really showed out his senior year and PFF had him graded as a 89.8 with 4 sacks, he was named to the 1st team All SEC team for the season.
pros: Super athletic for an interior lineman. First step is very quick, he can penetrate and get across lineman in a hurry. High motor, will try to chase down QBs relentlessly. Good size and power, wont get moved by one blocker.
cons: Isn’t an excellent pass rusher, doesn’t have a quick move to win with. Loses his gap integrity too often trying to make a play.
take: Wyatt jumps off the film when watching Georgias DL, you can definitely tell that he’s an NFL player. He should be able to step in and start immediately but he probably will only be a good not great DL.
DL Jordan Davis Georgia 84
info: Davis somehow was only a 3 star recruit coming out of Mallard Creek in NC but Georgia saw the 6’6 340 pounder and knew he could dominate. They were right, as a freshman he was a Freshman All American and kept getting better. By his senior year he was the Bednarik award winner 1st team All SEC and All American.
pros: Not a human, he is 6’6 340 and runs a sub 4.8 40 yard dash. Absolute monster in the run game, can throw OL man around and move them with ease. Double teams can barley move him at all. Pushes the pocket well and fires off the ball well.
cons: 3 sacks as a career high, not much production. Never played over 400 snaps in a season. Lateral movement skills leave a lot to be desired. Plays a little to high at time, being 6’6 he has to focus on firing out low.
take: Davis may be the easiest evaluation of the year. You know you are getting a big man that will stop the run and is a great athlete. His pass rush production is an unknown but he’s no liability because of his athleticism.
DL Travis Jones Uconn 78
info: Jones didn’t belong at UCONN he was one of the best DL in the country. He has gotten 8  sacks over the last 2 years and dominated Clemson when they played.
pros: Great strength at the point of attack, both holding ground in the run game and penetrating. Man handles offensive lineman while pass rushing. Good athlete on the interior, changes direction fast.
cons: Doesn’t have a plan pass rushing, just throws lineman. Doesn’t keep lineman off him in the run game. Not much real competition played.
take: Jones had some very impressive tape, especially against good competition. He still has stuff he can get better at but he has the physical ability to be a good NFL DL.
DL DeMarvin Leal Texas A&M 78
info: Leal came out of Judson high school in Texas where he was heavily recruited as a consensus 5-star recruit. He immediately made an impact starting 7 out of his first 10 games as a true freshman. With guys like him, Bobby Brown, and Buddy Johnson the 2020 Texas A&M defense was a force.
pros: Good length. Shows great bend in the run game against pull blocks. Does a great job using hands to swipe and get hand off him. Shows fantastic power in both pass and run game. Sweet spin moves especially for size.
cons: Kind of a tweaner size, to big for edge at 290. Doesn’t have the juice to get to the edge in the pass game. Not very twitchy
take: Leal has shown a great ability to put pressure on the quarterback in multiple different ways. Although he’s a bit of a tweaner he still possesses power to stop the run inside and rush on the edge. He’s a versatile defensive lineman that can contribute in any scheme from multiple positions.
DL Perrion Winfrey Oklahoma 76
info: Winfrey is another JUCO star from Iowa Western where he was rated the number 1 JUCO recruit. He didn’t have the grades initially so Iowa State recommended he goes the JUCO route but he was to heavily recruited to go to Iowa State. He was a 2 year starter for the Sooners where he was named 2nd team big 12 both years. He may have graded worse in 2021 per PFF but got 5.5 sacks to close out his college career.
pros: Quick first step that can cause penetration. When he gets hands on OL he can walk them back.
cons: He looks awkward moving in space. No  pass rush plan at all, runs forward and sees what happens. Can’t hold up in double teams, his anchor isn’t good and will get washed out.
take: Winfrey has an explosive first step and some reps that make you think he could be a force on the DL. Unfortunately there are too many plays he gets washed out of his gap and looks like he has no idea what’s going on. A team should use a late round pick to hopefully get some DL depth.
DL Logan Hall Houston 75
info: Hall was a 3 star recruit coming out of Belton Texas and chose to stay close to home and commit to Houston. He contributed immediately but really only produced his senior year where he racked up 6 sacks.
pros: Great length, 6’6 with long arms. Fires off the ball low and can beat 1v1s. Gets off blocks to make plays. Rushes very hard with a high motor.
cons: Can’t hold up versus double teams at all. Tweaner, between an edge and a DL. Doesn’t get his arms extended on lineman. Complained about San diego being a bit chilly.
take: Hall is a very interesting player, there’s not many 6’6 270 pound interior DL. He has a lot of things to like but finding a way on the field for him may be difficult.
DL Eyioma Uwazurike Iowa St 75
info: NA
pros: Solid build, 6’6 316 35 inch arms and a solid athlete. Played 5 years and started 4 years. Great at pushing the pocket with length.
cons: No pass rush moves, doesn’t even attempt it. Not quick, won’t make any quick sudden moves. Plays a little too high at times.
take: Uwazurike has a freaky build at 6’6 320 with long arms. He’s great at pushing a pocket and can be solid in the run game, but for 4 years he hasn’t shown any next level moves/plays.
DL Otito Ogbonnia UCLA 74
info: Ogbonnia is a Nigerian born player who was a good prospect coming out of Texas. He not only is good at football but he plans to become a lawyer after his football career and was on the deans list every year. He became a full time starter his senior year and was a solid presence in the middle of the Bruins defense.
pros: Massive dude, 6’4 330. Hard to move, takes a double team to get him back.
cons: No pass rush, moves aren’t there. Slow pass rush, slow out of stance, slow running, slow changing direction.
take: Ogbonnia is a run stopping DL that can’t rush the passer. If your looking for a big body to take up a gap he’s worth a pick but doesn’t have anything passed that.
DL Kalia Davis UCF 74
info: NA
pros: Stout build at 6’1 302 with 33.5 inch arms. Quick off the line, can get lateral in a hurry. Controls blocks well by getting in to his pads well. Flashes quick pass rushes.
cons: Played 5 games his senior season and missed all of 2020. A lot of non effective pass rushes, doesn’t collapse pocket or put a move on consistently.
take: Davis has a lot to like about his game, he is a stout quick lineman that flashed when he played. The only concern is the lack of actual playing he did, he missed so much time with injury and lacks the pass rush to be a
DL Thomas Booker Stanford 73
info: NA
pros: Very good athlete, at 6’3 310 he did 31 reps on the bench and ran a sub 5 second 40. 3 year starter as well as a team captain. Can hold up well in the run game 1v1.
cons: Never graded well in PFF over his career. Almost no pass rush production or moves to his game. Get beat by double teams bad.
take: Booker has the makeup for a great 3-4 D end with his strength and athleticism. He hasn’t shown much in pass rush or any production, but he has the potential to have a solid career.
DL Neil Farrell LSU 73
info: Farrell was a 3 star recruit coming out of mobile Alabama and committed to LSU. He played all 5 years at LSU but didn’t become a full time starter until 2021 (thanks to a loaded DL room in LSU). But he made the most of it by grading close to 90 for PFF and being named 2nd ALL SEC by the AP.
pros: One of the best run defenders in the class. Good extension to keep OL off of him. Great power, hard to move backwards and resets the line of scrimmage. Great at shedding blocks once a RB commits to a hole.
cons: Not a good athlete, his first step isn’t good and he can’t shoot gaps. No pass rush to speak of other than a straight bull rush.
take: Farrell is a run stopper and there is no doubt about it. At 6’4 320 and as strong as he is I have no doubts he will continue to be a plus defender against the run. He has his pass game limitations but a run stuffing DT is still valuable.
DL Phidarian Mathis Alabama 73
info: Mathis was a consensus 4 star recruit out of Louisiana and committed to bama over hometown LSU. He red shirted his freshman year in 2017 and got more and more playing time every year. His final year was his best registering 9 sacks and was a team captain for the Tide.
pros: Great holding up to doubles in the run game, tough guy to move. Has shown good pass rush moves both on the interior and on the tackle. Pushes the pocket well with long arms.
cons: Comes off the ball slower than you would like to see. Not a good athlete, lets QBs scramble away from him easily.
take: Mathis is another big strong interior player for Alabama. He’s not an elite athlete like his former predecessors, but he is a strong run defender that should be able to play in the NFL (especially on early downs).
DT Mathew Butler Tennessee 72
info: NA
pros: Solid build and length, 6’4 300 33.5 inch arms. Good at shooting gaps, can get upfield well. High motor, always pushing to get into the backfield. Strong base, hand to move out of the way 1v1.
cons: Doesn’t control lineman in the run game, doesn’t get hands on. Doesn’t read blocks well at all, goes straight up the field. His pass rush is average, he throws rip moves but doesn’t have the punch behind his moves.
take: Butler is a well built solid defensive lineman that could add depth to a team. He will never be a plus starter because he’s not an elite athlete or good rusher, but he’s very solid.
DL Matt Henningsen Wisconsin 70
info: NA
pros: Good against the run, can hold the point of attack well. Great hands in the run game, strikes well and rips off.
cons: On the smaller side at 6’2 286. Not much pass rush to his game, more of a 2 down player.
take: Henningsen is your typical 2 down stop the run player. He is very sound in his assignments but doesn’t offer anything extra.
DL Noah Elliss Idaho 69
info: NA
pros: Big man, 6.4 346 pounds, his dad is a former all pro. Good anchor, can hold down the line of scrimmage well.
cons: No real competition. Doesn’t have much behind his game, no athleticism or moves.
take: Elliss is a big man who can play 0 tech for a team. He’s not that good though he doesn’t offer much upside, just a big body.
DL Haskell Garrett Ohio St 68
info: Haskell was a 4 star recruit coming out of the power house HS Bishop Gorman in LV. He has been a consistent force on the Ohio State DL for the last 5 years and was looking for a breakout season before he turned pro. He never really got that season unfortunately and had to compete with a crowded DL room for reps.
pros: Shows a variety of pass rush moves. Has some plays where he explodes off the line and splits double teams. Uses a swim move to shed defenders well.
cons: Doesn’t have a bull rush to his game. Has no anchor in the run game. Not very disruptive at any point in his career.
take: Garrett should have been dominating OL because he was a 5th year senior, but he always seemed out matched in the strength department. This doesn’t project well and he at most could be a rotational depth piece on the DL.
DL John Ridgeway Arkansas 68
info: Ridgeway played 4 years at Illinois state where in 2018 he was named an FCS All American. He transferred to Arkansas for his final year where he started for the razorbacks. He finished the season with 2 sacks and a 60 grade from PFF.
pros: Large man 6’6 320. Good length, he can extend well.
cons: He gets blown off the ball consistently. No twitch to his game, just a big guy not much of an athlete.
take: Ridgeway is another big body guy that can’t hold up against better competition. He doesn’t have the strength to play the run and isn’t much of a pass rusher. He should get a shot on a roster but he doesn’t seem to be a high level player.
DL Antwuan Jackson Ohio St 66
info: Jackson was the Georgia Gatorade player of the year which was quite the accomplishment. He committed and attended Auburn for his first year of college before going to a local JUCO college. He dominated there becoming the nations top JUCO recruit and committing to Ohio State. There he was used mostly as a early down rotational DL that never flashed that much.
pros: Solid in the run game against power. Was the Georgia player of the year so showed flashed in HS and JUCO.
cons: Never really impacted games at Ohio State. No pass rush to his game. Not explosive off the ball.
take: Jackson was just another guy along side a crowded Ohio State DL. Maybe an NFL training camp can get him to reach his potential but it doesn’t seem likely that he will be an impact player in the NFL.
DL Labryan Ray Alabama 68
info: NA
pros: Good at holding his spot in the run game. Even at 283 he can handle anything in the run game.
cons: Bit of a tweener at 6’4 283 (only 8 inch hands). Didn’t get that many snaps over his 5 seasons. No pass rush to his game, cant bull or get around.
take: Ray is an undersized run stopper which isn’t a good combo. He should get a chance but should be undrafted.
DL Cody Roscoe Syracuse 67
info: NA
pros: Stupid athletic, had a great pro day. Great production, 12 sacks for his final year with 110 pressures in 4 years. Named to the first team All ACC team in 2021 and won the Tim Green Award for best Cuse DL. Good bend for a bigger guy, can change direction well. Has good acceleration off the line and can be dangerous off stunts.
cons: Undersized DL, 6’1 275 pounds. On the older side, 2016 his career started and McNeese State. Tough against the run, has no length to hold his ground. Unless he gets to a spot he has no rush moves to win 1v1.
take: Roscoe is a great athlete with less than ideal size. He showed a lot of promise at cuse but his length will limit him, no chance he can be a dominate player.
