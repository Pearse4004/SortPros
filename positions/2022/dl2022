DL DeMarvin Leal Texas A&M 84
info: Leal came out of Judson high school in Texas where he was heavily recruited as a consensus 5-star recruit. He immediately made an impact starting 7 out of his first 10 games as a true freshman. With guys like him, Bobby Brown, and Buddy Johnson the 2020 Texas A&M defense was a force.
pros: Good length. Shows great bend in the run game against pull blocks. Does a great job using hands to swipe and get hand off him. Shows fantastic power in both pass and run game. Sweet spin moves especially for size.
cons: Kind of a tweaner size, to big for edge at 290. Doesn’t have the juice to get to the edge in the pass game. Not very twitchy
takeaway: Leal has shown a great ability to put pressure on the quarterback in multiple different ways. Although he’s a bit of a tweaner he still possesses power to stop the run inside and rush on the edge. He’s a versatile defensive lineman that can contribute in any scheme from multiple positions.
