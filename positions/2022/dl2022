DL DeMarvin Leal Texas A&M 82
info: Leal came out of Judson high school in Texas where he was heavily recruited as a consensus 5-star recruit. He immediately made an impact starting 7 out of his first 10 games as a true freshman. With guys like him, Bobby Brown, and Buddy Johnson the 2020 Texas A&M defense was a force.
pros: Good length. Shows great bend in the run game against pull blocks. Does a great job using hands to swipe and get hand off him. Shows fantastic power in both pass and run game. Sweet spin moves especially for size.
cons: Kind of a tweaner size, to big for edge at 290. Doesn’t have the juice to get to the edge in the pass game. Not very twitchy
take: Leal has shown a great ability to put pressure on the quarterback in multiple different ways. Although he’s a bit of a tweaner he still possesses power to stop the run inside and rush on the edge. He’s a versatile defensive lineman that can contribute in any scheme from multiple positions.
DL Haskell Garrett Ohio St 68
info: Haskell was a 4 star recruit coming out of the power house HS Bishop Gorman in LV. He has been a consistent force on the Ohio State DL for the last 5 years and was looking for a breakout season before he turned pro. He never really got that season unfortunately and had to compete with a crowded DL room for reps.
pros: Shows a variety of pass rush moves. Has some plays where he explodes off the line and splits double teams. Uses a swim move to shed defenders well.
cons: Doesn’t have a bull rush to his game. Has no anchor in the run game. Not very disruptive at any point in his career.
take: Garrett should have been dominating OL because he was a 5th year senior, but he always seemed out matched in the strength department. This doesn’t project well and he at most could be a rotational depth piece on the DL.
DL Antwuan Jackson Ohio St 66
info: Jackson was the Georgia Gatorade player of the year which was quite the accomplishment. He committed and attended Auburn for his first year of college before going to a local JUCO college. He dominated there becoming the nations top JUCO recruit and committing to Ohio State. There he was used mostly as a early down rotational DL that never flashed that much.
pros: Solid in the run game against power. Was the Georgia player of the year so showed flashed in HS and JUCO.
cons: Never really impacted games at Ohio State. No pass rush to his game. Not explosive off the ball.
take: Jackson was just another guy along side a crowded Ohio State DL. Maybe an NFL training camp can get him to reach his potential but it doesn’t seem likely that he will be an impact player in the NFL.
