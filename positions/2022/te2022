TE Jeremy Ruckert Ohio St 77
info: After winning NY Gatorade Player of the year Ruckert decided to not go to Syracuse and go to Ohio State instead. He immediately played because his size and athletic ability but never had a major role at OSU. His final season he was the lead guy at the tight end position but he didn’t get that breakout year that he was hoping.
pros: Perfect TE build, he was built in a lab. Great athlete for the position. Dominate run blocker in college. Can separate really well in routes.
cons: Didn’t get the volume in the OSU offense. Not consistently dominating blocks and running from defenders.
take: Ruckert was the most underutilized TE ever in college football, he only caught 26 balls even though he was open so often. He is going to be a good possibly great NFL tight end.
TE Trey McBride Colorado St 79
info: Was a 3 sport athlete in high school where he left his legacy on Fort Morgan in Colorado by breaking the record for most career points (basketball) and RBIs. He committed to Colorado State where he played as a freshman then was named 1st team all mountain west by his second year. He was a team captain the rest of his career and capped it off by winning the Mackey award, being names a 1st team all American and receiving 1125 yards as a tight end.
pros: Was Colorado States offense receiving over 1000 yards. Received a 94.7 grade from PFF and had some of the best hands in the nation. Produced though triple teams and was the clear focus of the defense. Split out wide to win jump balls. Great ball skills, does a great job adjusting to catch the ball. Good hands and base while blocking, very willing to block.
cons: Not a great athlete, doesn’t blow anyone away with speed or strength. Not a dominate blocker, doesn’t create much movement.
take: McBride is a very good tight end, you can tell by both the numbers and the tape. He is clearly the best player on Colorado State and the only negative is he’s not a super human athlete. He can step in immediately and be a teams top tight end and possibly a top half of the league tight end.
TE Isaiah Likely Costal Carolina 75
info: NA
pros: 93.3 receiving grade with very few drops his last year. 912 yards and 12 Tds his senior year. 2nd team All American and clearly the 2nd best TE in the nation last year. Good vertical threat as a tight end, solid speed and athletic ability. Can split out to run receiver routes.
cons: Didn’t play much top tier competition. A little soft in the run game, not a sturdy blocker. Not the strongest tight end, a little slender. 2020 had a lot of drops.
take: Likely is the typical split out tight end where he can be a plus receiving threat as a move TE. He doesn’t have the nastiness to be an inline blocker yet, but he could get there by adding to his frame.
TE Cade Otton Washington 73
info: NA
pros: 4 year starter and an All-PAC 12 first team selection. Can change pace in his routes well, solid acceleration. Willing blocker, wants to get inline and get to work. Good hands, not many drops in his career.
cons: Never had over 350 receiving yards in a season, didn’t put up much stats. Can get overpowered by better run defenders. Not a twitchy or fast athlete, can’t separate with physical skills.
take: Otton was a very solid tight end for the huskies, he was a willing blocker and a solid pass option. He’s limited do to his lack of physical traits but he certainly is an NFL tight end.
TE Greg Dulcich UCLA 70
info: NA
pros: Averaged 17+ YPC his final year, good vertical threat. Plays with good aggression and willing to block. Solid athlete that can be split out wide.
cons: Too weak while blocking, doesn’t move anyone. Movements aren’t efficient and slows him down at the line.
take: Dulcich was an ok tight end at UCLA, he was a plus receiver with ok blocking ability. He never showed out though, he couldn’t dominate at any part of the game and will only be a guy.
