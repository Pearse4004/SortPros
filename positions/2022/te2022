TE Jeremy Ruckert Ohio St 78
info: After winning NY Gatorade Player of the year Ruckert decided to not go to Syracuse and go to Ohio State instead. He immediately played because his size and athletic ability but never had a major role at OSU. His final season he was the lead guy at the tight end position but he didn’t get that breakout year that he was hoping.
pros: Perfect TE build, he was built in a lab. Great athlete for the position. Dominate run blocker in college. Can separate really well in routes.
cons: Didn’t get the volume in the OSU offense. Not consistently dominating blocks and running from defenders.
take: Ruckert was the most underutilized TE ever in college football, he only caught 26 balls even though he was open so often. He is going to be a good possibly great NFL tight end.
