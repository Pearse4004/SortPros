QB Spencer Rattler Oklahoma 89
info: Rattler was a 5 star recruit out of Pinnacle in Phoenix AZ and committed to Oklahoma in 2019. He sat one year behind Jalen Hurts seeing playing time in three games attempting only 11 passes. 2020 was the first time he got starting action and he thrived with a PFF passing grade of 92.5 throwing for 3000 yards. 28 TDs and 7 INTs. In the 2020 season he initially struggled a little getting benched against Texas and put back in which was the turning point in the season for Oklahoma.
pros: Top QB recruit. Good mobility. Awesome Screen accuracy. Good out of structure. Arm talent is very apparent. Does find checkdown well on occasion. Threads needle like no other. Addition in the run game he is very elusive. TCU falling away threw a 50-yard dot. Murdered Texas Tech. Got better through 2020. elite ball placement. Highlight play waiting to happen. Change of direction is very good. 60-yard bomb against Florida.
cons: Unknown suspension in high school (although not bad). Undersized at 6’1 200. dips the ball before the throw. lazy on some throws with feet. Anticipation is not where it needs to be. Makes aggressive decision to a fault. Dances too much in the pocket. Tries to play hero ball too much. Too many back feet throws away from pressure. Had a lot of good blocking at Oklahoma causing him to hold ball for a long time. Missed so many easy shallow crossers. Mostly a one read quarterback, Doesn’t work the pocket much if at all.
takeaway: Rattler is fun to watch, he’s exactly what you would expect a playmaker to be. The question is can he develop and be safer with the ball and play more in structure.
QB Sam Howell North Carolina 91
Info: Howell was a highly rated quarterback coming out of Sun Valley high school in North Carolina where he won the award for Gatorade player of the year for North Carolina. He decided to stay local and he immediately won the starting QB job his freshman year. He played well both years especially in 2020 racking up 3500 yards, 30 TDs and 7 INTs. According to PFF he had a 91.5 grade and had may big time throws (30) with only 8 turnover worthy plays. This impressive season landed him a second team All ACC selection only behind the Trevor Lawrence.
pros: Good stocky build. Solid athleticism for position. Works a pocket well. Good accuracy all over the field. Beautiful deep ball, best in the country. Can play both within structure and outside at a high level. Can make full field reads already with regularity. Elusive against the rush. Great base on throws every time. Fits tight window slants a lot. Understands windows in zones and throws receiver into space. Don’t give him a clean pocket to throw from, he’s deadly from there.
cons: Not an ideal height at only 6’1/6’2. His release is a little slow in the short game. Doesn’t find hot receiver well when faced with unblocked pressure. Has moments where he doesn’t care about safeties over the top. Only an average NFL arm. Would like to see slightly quicker decisions, sometimes overthinks it. Needs to learn to throw away and live for another day. Playmakers in 2020 really helped him. Please don’t pat the ball every time you throw, although doesn’t do it in quick game. Played worse against good SEC competition when things weren’t going his way
takeaway: Howell is the kind of quarterback that I have a hard time seeing fail in the NFL. He has shown ability to go through full field read, evade rushers in the pocket and throw dots to covered receivers down the field. Although he may not have the arm strength to put a team on his back, if Howell is in a good situation he will light up defenses.
QB D’eriq King Miami 76
info: King was a good recruit coming out of Manvel in Texas where he actually started over the second-round pick Kyle Trask and got to compete in the elite 11. His rood to Miami was bumpy though, he originally committed to TCU before flipping that to Houston where he started his college career.  It started well and in 2018 he broke out and headed into the 2019 season as a Heisman contender. Early in the season Houston was struggling so the Head Coach asked king to sit out a year so he saves eligibility. King did that but instead of coming back he transferred to Miami where in 2020 he lead the hurricanes back to a winning team before tearing his ACL in their bowl game. He immediately became a team leader becoming a team captain in 2020 and earned All ACC Honorable mention to go along with it. PFF backs this theme up, he received an 88 passing grade while throwing 21 big time throws to go along with 7 turnover worthy plays.
pros: Understands how to throw receivers open. Good use of touch and power on different throws. Good athlete, can be a part of run game. Always has a good base under him. Throws with solid anticipation.
cons: Undersized through and through. Old prospect, going to have 6 college years under his belt. Tore ACL in bowl game in 2020. Mediocre NFL arm strength. Deep ball accuracy is very inconsistent. Maybe because his playmakers weren’t great but off script never made many big plays down the field. Struggles a lot with pressure up the middle.
takeaway: King is a great college quarterback and a team leader. He has shown that he can operate an offense and hit the open receivers as well as use his legs to give the offense an extra element. He isn’t the NFL caliber player physically being under 6 feet and not having a great arm, but he certainly can operate in the NFL.
QB Malik Willis 85 Liberty
info: Willis was tagged as a 3 star recruit coming out of Roswell in Atlanta Georgia. He didn’t receive many offers but he got a few including one from Auburn where he ended up committing. He followed his former Offensive coordinator to Liberty in 2019 and sat out a year because of the transfer rules. In his first year starting he showed sparks. He earned an 83 PFF rushing grade and made defenders miss at a RB level. His passing was good and bad, he ended up having 20 BTT compared to 19 TWP.
pros: Has the most live arm in the draft. Great running ability, looks like a slowed down Lamar Jackson. Off platform throws look easy. Solid accuracy short and intermediate. Can fit the ball in very tight zone windows.
cons: Sloppy feet. Doesn’t hold on to the ball well. Doesn’t go through reads consistently. Totally unrefined as a quarterback.
takeaway: Willis has the raw tools to be the best quarterback in the NFL and it’s not close. He is a very raw prospect but given a good coaching staff and a willingness to learn and dedicate himself to the position may lead him to be a future hall of famer.
