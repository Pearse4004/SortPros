QB Spencer Rattler Oklahoma 89
info: Rattler was a 5 star recruit out of Pinnacle in Phoenix AZ and committed to Oklahoma in 2019. He sat one year behind Jalen Hurts seeing playing time in three games attempting only 11 passes. 2020 was the first time he got starting action and he thrived with a PFF passing grade of 92.5 throwing for 3000 yards. 28 TDs and 7 INTs. In the 2020 season he initially struggled a little getting benched against Texas and put back in which was the turning point in the season for Oklahoma.
pros: Top QB recruit. Good mobility. Awesome Screen accuracy. Good out of structure. Arm talent is very apparent. Does find checkdown well on occasion. Threads needle like no other. Addition in the run game he is very elusive. TCU falling away threw a 50-yard dot. Murdered Texas Tech. Got better through 2020. elite ball placement. Highlight play waiting to happen. Change of direction is very good. 60-yard bomb against Florida.
cons: Unknown suspension in high school (although not bad). Undersized at 6’1 200. dips the ball before the throw. lazy on some throws with feet. Anticipation is not where it needs to be. Makes aggressive decision to a fault. Dances too much in the pocket. Tries to play hero ball too much. Too many back feet throws away from pressure. Had a lot of good blocking at Oklahoma causing him to hold ball for a long time. Missed so many easy shallow crossers. Mostly a one read quarterback, Doesn’t work the pocket much if at all.
takeaway: Rattler is fun to watch, he’s exactly what you would expect a playmaker to be. The question is can he develop and be safer with the ball and play more in structure.
QB Sam Howell North Carolina 91
Info: Howell was a highly rated quarterback coming out of Sun Valley high school in North Carolina where he won the award for Gatorade player of the year for North Carolina. He decided to stay local and he immediately won the starting QB job his freshman year. He played well both years especially in 2020 racking up 3500 yards, 30 TDs and 7 INTs. According to PFF he had a 91.5 grade and had may big time throws (30) with only 8 turnover worthy plays. This impressive season landed him a second team All ACC selection only behind the Trevor Lawrence.
pros: Good stocky build. Solid athleticism for position. Works a pocket well. Good accuracy all over the field. Beautiful deep ball, best in the country. Can play both within structure and outside at a high level. Can make full field reads already with regularity. Elusive against the rush. Great base on throws every time. Fits tight window slants a lot. Understands windows in zones and throws receiver into space. Don’t give him a clean pocket to throw from, he’s deadly from there.
cons: Not an ideal height at only 6’1/6’2. His release is a little slow in the short game. Doesn’t find hot receiver well when faced with unblocked pressure. Has moments where he doesn’t care about safeties over the top. Only an average NFL arm. Would like to see slightly quicker decisions, sometimes overthinks it. Needs to learn to throw away and live for another day. Playmakers in 2020 really helped him. Please don’t pat the ball every time you throw, although doesn’t do it in quick game. Played worse against good SEC competition when things weren’t going his way
takeaway: Howell is the kind of quarterback that I have a hard time seeing fail in the NFL. He has shown ability to go through full field read, evade rushers in the pocket and throw dots to covered receivers down the field. Although he may not have the arm strength to put a team on his back, if Howell is in a good situation he will light up defenses.
