LB Nakobe Dean Georgia 89
info: Nakobe was a consensus 5 star recruit and the top player coming out of Mississippi. He decided to commit to Georgia over playing with his brother at ole miss. To say Dean was successful at Georgia is an understatement, he lead their defense to being one of the best of all time while studying Mechanical Engineering. He had a good first 2 years for the Bulldogs immediately making an impact for the team, but his senior year is where he showed out. He was a captain, an All American as well as the Butkus award winner (and should have been the Bednarik award winner).
pros: Great athlete for a linebacker. Plays like his life depends on it, very aggressive when attacking a play. Good movement skills in coverage, can stick with vertical routes and RBs. Good at tackling in open space, not many missed. Great blitzer, gets around lineman well and times it perfectly. Good play recognition, sniffs out screens well.
cons: Smaller frame, may struggle to take on blocks and hold ground. A little to aggressive tacker, dives a lot with his head down. Not the greatest feel in zone, Looks robotic until matched up on a receiver.
take: Dean was the best linebacker in college football and he has it all aside from the lack of size. He was a great leader and a tremendous player which should translate and make him an immediate impact player for whoever drafts him.
