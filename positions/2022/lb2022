LB Nakobe Dean Georgia 88
info: Nakobe was a consensus 5 star recruit and the top player coming out of Mississippi. He decided to commit to Georgia over playing with his brother at ole miss. To say Dean was successful at Georgia is an understatement, he lead their defense to being one of the best of all time while studying Mechanical Engineering. He had a good first 2 years for the Bulldogs immediately making an impact for the team, but his senior year is where he showed out. He was a captain, an All American as well as the Butkus award winner (and should have been the Bednarik award winner).
pros: Great athlete for a linebacker. Plays like his life depends on it, very aggressive when attacking a play. Good movement skills in coverage, can stick with vertical routes and RBs. Good at tackling in open space, not many missed. Great blitzer, gets around lineman well and times it perfectly. Good play recognition, sniffs out screens well.
cons: Smaller frame, may struggle to take on blocks and hold ground. A little to aggressive tacker, dives a lot with his head down. Not the greatest feel in zone, Looks robotic until matched up on a receiver.
take: Dean was the best linebacker in college football and he has it all aside from the lack of size. He was a great leader and a tremendous player which should translate and make him an immediate impact player for whoever drafts him.
LB Devin Lloyd Utah 79
info: Lloyd was a star safety coming out of Otay Ranch in California. He wasn’t a top recruit so when Utah offered he decided to join the Utes great defense. He reshirtted his first year and then started his R-So. He broke out in 2020 being named first team pac 12 and then in 2021 was seen as the second best backer in the nation behind dean. 
pros: good size at 6’3 225. Leader of a great defense for Utah. Good tackler, wraps up well. Good recognition in the pass game. Good pass rusher for the position. Good instincts overall, around the ball all the time.
cons: Not very good change of direction. Doesn’t come downhill enough to blow up blockers. A little on the thin and can get out matched by lineman.  
take: Lloyd was a great college backer due to his good athleticism and his instincts. His athleticism will be negated in the NFL but his instincts and leadership should allow him to be a starting linebacker in the league
