LB Nakobe Dean Georgia 84
info: Nakobe was a consensus 5 star recruit and the top player coming out of Mississippi. He decided to commit to Georgia over playing with his brother at ole miss. To say Dean was successful at Georgia is an understatement, he lead their defense to being one of the best of all time while studying Mechanical Engineering. He had a good first 2 years for the Bulldogs immediately making an impact for the team, but his senior year is where he showed out. He was a captain, an All American as well as the Butkus award winner (and should have been the Bednarik award winner).
pros: Great athlete for a linebacker. Plays like his life depends on it, very aggressive when attacking a play. Good movement skills in coverage, can stick with vertical routes and RBs. Good at tackling in open space, not many missed. Great blitzer, gets around lineman well and times it perfectly. Good play recognition, sniffs out screens well.
cons: Smaller frame, may struggle to take on blocks and hold ground. A little to aggressive tacker, dives a lot with his head down. Not the greatest feel in zone, Looks robotic until matched up on a receiver.
take: Dean was the best linebacker in college football and he has it all aside from the lack of size. He was a great leader and a tremendous player which should translate and make him an immediate impact player for whoever drafts him.
LB Devin Lloyd Utah 83
info: Lloyd was a star safety coming out of Otay Ranch in California. He wasn’t a top recruit so when Utah offered he decided to join the Utes great defense. He reshirtted his first year and then started his R-So. He broke out in 2020 being named first team pac 12 and then in 2021 was seen as the second best backer in the nation behind dean. 
pros: good size at 6’3 225. Leader of a great defense for Utah. Good tackler, wraps up well. Good recognition in the pass game. Good pass rusher for the position. Good instincts overall, around the ball all the time.
cons: Not very good change of direction. Doesn’t come downhill enough to blow up blockers. A little on the thin and can get out matched by lineman.  
take: Lloyd was a great college backer due to his good athleticism and his instincts. His athleticism will be negated in the NFL but his instincts and leadership should allow him to be a starting linebacker in the league
LB Troy Andersen Montana St 76
info: Andersen is one of the more intriguing players in the draft this year. Besides being a star on the field he’s great in the classroom where he was his class valedictorian as he held a 4.0 GPA. He wasn’t recruited much so he went to Montana State where he won the Big Sky Freshman of the year award playing at both RB and LB. His sophomore year he played QB and was named to the All-Big Sky first team. He then transitioned to defense where he was an All American and then named FCS Defensive player of the year.
pros: 6’3 240 runs a 4.4 and jumped 36-128 inches in the verticle and broad, he’s a freak. 100+ tackles his senior year as well as a team captain. Good open field tackler with his athleticism and length. Always around the ball, effort is there. Shows flashes that he can play zone well and locate receivers. Good recognition in the run/play action game, sees pullers/peeling tight ends well.
cons: Played in the FCS against lower level competition. Inconsistent in coverage, gets stuck looking in the backfield too often. Not aggressive in run fits, lets himself get blocked down the field too easy.
take: Andersen sure looks the part and played very well in the FCS. He got away with a lot though because he’s an NFL athlete playing in the FCS and will have growing pains. He needs to be more “instinctive” and trust what he sees and attack better. He would immediately come in and be an impressive athlete at the position, but he needs some development to get to his fullest potential.
LB Damone Clark LSU 74
info: NA
pros: Great tackler, sub 10% missed tackle rate. Has the makeup for the next level, got the size athleticism and SEC pedigree. Flashes ability to fill a gap and take on a blocker with physicality. Played well in the Bama game and was flying around the field.
cons: Looks hesitant at times not aggressively going after the ball. Takes poor angles, lets ball carriers cut right under him too often. A little slow when reacting to routes and breaking on them.
take: Clark is a solid Linebacker prospect with all the physical traits to be an NFL linebacker. He needs to play with more “instincts” and break on routes and fly to the ball better before he can be a starting NFL backer.
