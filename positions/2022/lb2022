LB Devin Lloyd Utah 84
info: Lloyd was a star safety coming out of Otay Ranch in California. He wasn’t a top recruit so when Utah offered he decided to join the Utes great defense. He reshirtted his first year and then started his R-So. He broke out in 2020 being named first team pac 12 and then in 2021 was seen as the second best backer in the nation behind dean.
pros: good size at 6’3 225. Leader of a great defense for Utah. Good tackler, wraps up well. Good recognition in the pass game. Good pass rusher for the position. Good instincts overall, around the ball all the time.
cons: Not very good change of direction. Doesn’t come downhill enough to blow up blockers. A little on the thin and can get out matched by lineman.
take: Lloyd was a great college backer due to his good athleticism and his instincts. His athleticism will be negated in the NFL but his instincts and leadership should allow him to be a starting linebacker in the league
LB Leo Chenal Wisconsin 81
info: Chenal was a star coming out of Grantsburg WI where he was named Gatorade Player of the year for his senior season. He didn’t draw much interest though, only being tagged as a 3 star recruit he only visited Minnesota, Iowa and Wisconsin. He stayed local and committed to Wisconsin where he didn’t get much playing time his first year. He got the full time starting role his sophomore season and was solid but he really turned it on his junior year. He was named 1st team All Big 10 and a 91.5 PFF grade for his final season.
pros: Great athlete, tested well and did 34 reps on the bench. Great at finding gaps in the offensive line and knifing through. Packs a punch when he takes on offensive lineman.
cons: Not the best length, sub 32 inch arms. A little slow to react in pass coverage, sees seam routes a tad too late.
take: Chenal is a strong, fast and quick linebacker who was dominate in the run game. He’s strong enough to take on blocks and quick enough to beat blockers. He needs to improve in the pass game but he’s still young so he can get better.
LB Nakobe Dean Georgia 80
info: Nakobe was a consensus 5 star recruit and the top player coming out of Mississippi. He decided to commit to Georgia over playing with his brother at ole miss. To say Dean was successful at Georgia is an understatement, he lead their defense to being one of the best of all time while studying Mechanical Engineering. He had a good first 2 years for the Bulldogs immediately making an impact for the team, but his senior year is where he showed out. He was a captain, an All American as well as the Butkus award winner (and should have been the Bednarik award winner).
pros: Good athlete for a linebacker. Plays like his life depends on it, very aggressive when attacking a play. Good movement skills in coverage, can stick with vertical routes and RBs. Good at tackling in open space, not many missed. Great blitzer, gets around lineman well and times it perfectly. Good play recognition, sniffs out screens well and sees everything in front of him.
cons: Smaller frame, may struggle to take on blocks and hold ground. A little to aggressive tacker, dives a lot with his head down. Not the greatest feel in zone, Looks robotic until matched up on a receiver.
take: Dean was the onr og the best linebacker in college football and he has it all aside from his size. He was a great leader and a tremendous player which should translate and make him an immediate impact player for whoever drafts him.
LB Quay Walker Georgia 78
info: NA
pros: Great build, 6’4 240 who ran a 4.52. One of the best tackler in college football, rarely missed one. Good run game recognition, flows to the ball in a hurry. Physical enough to take on a block and still find the ball.
cons: Not a great coverage player, won’t stay with more athletic players. Doesn’t have the greatest vision in pass coverage to diagnose routes developing.
take: Walker isn’t too far off Dean in terms of NFL prospect. He may not be as good in coverage but with his athleticism and size he can be a force in the middle of any defense.
LB Darrian Beavers Cincinnati 78
info: NA
pros: Ideal size at 6’4 237, looks the part. Good agility testing, sub 7 3 cone and 4.28 shuttle. Good at shedding and taking on blocks, can play the run well. Good assignment integrity, doesn’t bite on misdirection.
cons: Doesn’t have the closing speed or range you would like. Misses too many tackles, 15% miss rate. Lines up as a pass rusher a lot but has no moves.
take: Looking at Beavers you can tell that he’s an NFL backer. He tested well and graded well which are two good signs that he can be a good backer in the NFL. The only downside is you don’t see the burst you would like to see from a backer.
LB Channing Tindall Georgia 77
info: Tindall was a 4 star recruit out of Spring valley in SC where he was the SC DPOY in the state. He was a contributor for his first 3 years and finally got his shot his senior year and capitalized. He was 2nd team All American and racked up 8 sacks.
pros: He is an absolute freak athlete, 6’2 230 ran a 4.47 and jumped 42 inches. Doesn’t miss many tackles, super athletic and aggressive. Good blitzer, will run through a running back and get to a quarterback in a hurry.
cons: Single year starter. Doesn’t do well in coverage, doesn’t see things well and react.
take: Tindall is very similar to Kenneth Murray, they are both freaks who can come downhill in a hurry. But, they also both struggle in coverage and diagnosing what’s happening. That may be the reason he only saw the field his senior year.
LB Brian Asamoah Oklahoma 77
info: NA
pros: Good athlete, tested well and showed sideline to sideline range on tape. Very fluid in open field, can cover well with movement skills.  Very aggressive coming downhill to make a play on the ball.
cons: Smaller frame, looks more like a box safety.  Doesn’t play the run well, doesn’t take on blocks well at all. Played in a Big 12 league where he didn’t have to stop the run much.
take: Asamoah is a top tier pass coverage LB coming out of college. He moves so well in space he can be confused for a safety. The trade off is he doesn’t have the ability to be a consistent run defender at that size.
LB Troy Andersen Montana St 76
info: Andersen is one of the more intriguing players in the draft this year. Besides being a star on the field he’s great in the classroom where he was his class valedictorian as he held a 4.0 GPA. He wasn’t recruited much so he went to Montana State where he won the Big Sky Freshman of the year award playing at both RB and LB. His sophomore year he played QB and was named to the All-Big Sky first team. He then transitioned to defense where he was an All American and then named FCS Defensive player of the year.
pros: 6’3 240 runs a 4.4 and jumped 36-128 inches in the verticle and broad, he’s a freak. 100+ tackles his senior year as well as a team captain. Good open field tackler with his athleticism and length. Always around the ball, effort is there. Shows flashes that he can play zone well and locate receivers. Good recognition in the run/play action game, sees pullers/peeling tight ends well.
cons: Played in the FCS against lower level competition. Inconsistent in coverage, gets stuck looking in the backfield too often. Not aggressive in run fits, lets himself get blocked down the field too easy.
take: Andersen sure looks the part and played very well in the FCS. He got away with a lot though because he’s an NFL athlete playing in the FCS and will have growing pains. He needs to be more “instinctive” and trust what he sees and attack better. He would immediately come in and be an impressive athlete at the position, but he needs some development to get to his fullest potential.
LB Chad Muma Wyoming 76
info: NA
pros: Good build at 6’3 240 and ran a 4.6 27 bench reps and a 40 inch vert. Led the nation in tackles, 115 credited tackles. Received a 90+ grade as a senior. Good tackler who is great at pursuit (speed and instincts).
cons: Played at a low level of competition. Doesn’t attack downhill as well as you would like from a LB of his stature. Can’t play man coverage, not fluid enough of an athlete.
take: Muma is your new age prototypical LB with the size and athleticism to play in the NFL. He plays very sound and doesn’t appear out of place often but he played at a low level of competition.
LB Mike Rose Iowa St 76
info: NA
pros: 4 year starter, 2,757 snaps and graded above 70 each year. First team All Big 12 and Academic big 12. Had a 91.7 run defense grade in 2020. 6’4 245 and 33 inch arms and good jumping numbers.
cons: 16% missed tackle rate. Not the fastest player, could struggle sideline to sideline and in coverage.
take: Rose has great play recognition and good burst so playing in the box is where he will live. He’s a leader of the defense and could immediately step in and start with his size and IQ.
LB Micha Mcfadden Indiana 75
info: NA
pros: Team captain and 2nd team all big 10. Solid build and good in the run game, can take on blockers and fills his gap well. He’s a great blitzer, very productive rusher.
cons: Not the best athlete, he’s not going to impress in coverage.
take: Mcfadden is a football guy, very tough and a leader. He’s a limited athlete which will hurt his stock, but he’s such a solid player he could step in and be a 2 down backer.
LB Brandon Smith Penn St 74
info: NA
pros: Former 5 star who had the length size and speed to match. Has good range and can cover good athletes.
cons: Doesn’t want to play physical and is a bad tackler. Young inexperienced player who doesn’t see things well.
take: Smith is a pure project. A fantastic athlete with all the potential in the world but he needs a lot of work to get there.
LB Damone Clark LSU 72
info: NA
pros: Great tackler, sub 10% missed tackle rate. Has the makeup for the next level, got the size athleticism and SEC pedigree. Flashes ability to fill a gap and take on a blocker with physicality. Played well in the Bama game and was flying around the field.
cons: Looks hesitant at times not aggressively going after the ball. Takes poor angles, lets ball carriers cut right under him too often. A little slow when reacting to routes and breaking on them. Neck injury, missing his first year.
take: Clark is a solid Linebacker prospect with all the physical traits to be an NFL linebacker. He needs to play with more “instincts” and break on routes and fly to the ball better before he can be a starting NFL backer.
LB Jack Sanborn Wisconsin 72
info: Sanborn was a 4 star recruit coming out of Lake Zurich in Illinois where he was a dominate player. He committed to Wisconsin where he saw some action his true freshman year. By his second year he was the full time starter and the teams leading tackler. He got better every year and was selected to the 1st team All Big 10 and really improved on his tackling.
pros: Good blitzer, finds the holes in the OL well and attacks. Great at sifting over the OL and finding the ball carrier. Solid tackler, will pop the running back in the hole well.
cons: Struggled with tacking early in his career, 20% missed tackle rate. Lets misdirection get the best of him, blocked out of gap too easy. 30 inch arms limit his range on the field.
take: Sanborn was inconsistent in the run game, he had plays where he sniffed out the run great and others where he was drawn out of position. He’s a strong inside linebacker with the ability to play the run, cover and rush well. He’s limited with his length but he is a very solid player.
LB Christian Harris Alabama 71
info: NA
pros: Super athletic linebacker, ran a 4.44 and broad jumped 11 feet. Played all three years for the tide at linebacker. Sideline to sideline, runs well to ball carriers on the outside.
cons: Never graded out particularly well at any point. On the smaller side at 6 foot 226 pounds. Plays super high and not aggressive. Doesn’t seem to have instincts and the ability to beat blockers to a spot.
take: Harris is a great athlete who played for a top program for 3 years. He isn’t very instinctive though, he doesn’t play the way you would expect a top backer to play.
LB D'Marco Jackson Appalachian St 73
info: NA
pros: Team captain and sun belt defensive player of the year. Meets the measurement requirements, 6’1 233 32 inch arms and ran a 4.55, 33 inch vert and 10’5 broad. Has the burst to close in on ball carriers when needed. Good at getting underneath blocks of OL. Can cover pretty well, solid speed to run down the field.
cons: Nothing elite about his measurables, just has to be a good football player. Didn’t have a lot of pure coverage snaps where he’s running down the field. Shorter player that can get eaten up by OL. Wont play like a physical thumper when taking on blocks.
take: Jackson doesn’t have any of the elite traits you want in a MLB, but he was so solid at Appalachian. He’s a team captain that is a thickly built athlete who can do everything you want a linebacker to do. He should be able to step in and play immediately.
LB Jordan Young Old Dominion 73
info: NA
pros: A lit of snaps and improved every year, 2,932 snap. 78.8 grade with an 89.7 tackle grade. 6’3 230, solid build. Good athlete who can run with receivers and attack down field.
cons: Played against lower competition. Didn’t make the tackle on Malik Willis. Needs to play a little more in control and play coverage a little better.
take: Young was very good for old dominion and has the makeup to be an NFL linebacker. He could be developed into a good starter.
LB Baylon Spector Clemson 72
info: NA
pros: Team captain for his senior season. Solid athletic testing, 4.6 36 vertical 123 broad. Smooth in coverage, former safety that looks good in coverage. Has the speed to track a running back to the outside. Solid instincts, reads offenses plays fairly well.
cons: Not a very long player, 6 feet tall 31 inch arms. Doesn’t do well in the run game, doesn’t attack downhill that well and doesn’t take blocks well. Misses tackles too often, 12% miss rate his senior season.
take: Spector is a solid backer with the athleticism and intangibles that are looked for in the NFL. He’s on the smaller side which hurts his tackling and run defense so that should drop him down boards.
LB Malcom Rodriguez Oklahoma St 72
info: NA
pros: Captain his senior year. Explosive athlete, gets to top speed fast. Takes blocks very well with burst and leverage. 89 tackles his senior year,  always around the ball.
cons: A very short linebacker at sub 6 feet. Change of direction doesn’t match his burst. Doesn’t look natural in coverage, chopping back pedal.
take: Rodriguez is a powerful athlete with great burst on the field. He will be a great special teams player but his lack of height is concerning.  With his length limitation it only makes his lack of natural coverage instinct even worse.
LB Grant Morgan Arkansas 71
info: NA
pros: Won the Burlsworth award being a captain and a good player for Arkansas. 74.5 Defensive grade and good coverage grades.
cons: 5’11 doesn’t have the size and length.
take: Morgan is a football guy, you can tell how much he cares by his effort and play recognition. If he had the size and athleticism he would be a first rounder.
LB Joel Dublanko Cincinnati 73
info:
pros: Great size, 6’3 240, looks the part. 80.2 PFF grade and a solid tackler. Attacks downhill very well.
cons: One year full time starter. Not the best athlete at linebacker. Isn’t great sideline to sideline.
take: Dublanko lead the Cincinnati to a great season and has the size and ability to play in the NFL. He’s not the best athlete so he will be limited but he could play for a team immediately.
LB Aaron Hansford Texas A&M 71
info: NA
pros: Started out at wide receiver in 2016. Changes direction well for a 6’3 240 pounder. Can take on blocks and play physical in the run game.
cons: New to the position, looks lost at times reading the play. Not the fastest player, doesn’t have the juice you would want.
take: Hansford is a big strong backer who is relatively new to the position. He has troubles recognizing plays and reacting fast but he could get better and be a solid backer.
LB Kadofi Wright Buffalo 71
info: NA
pros: Very good athlete and solid build, ran a 4.51 and is 6’3 230. Made some great plays at buffalo and had back to back 85+ PFF graded seasons.
cons: Shouldn’t have gone back to school, 46 PFF grade as a senior. Not a physical player, a little lean and not powerful.
take: Wright is a weird player, he dominated in 2019-202 but dropped off significantly in run defense in 2021. He’s a long athlete who should be a good developmental piece.
LB Diego Fagot Navy 70
info: NA
pros: Leader of the Navy defense, character off the charts. 6’3 240 he’s a big dude that plays down hill.
cons: Stiff in coverage and isn’t the best athlete.
take: Fagot is a great story and a solid player, he’s somebody you want on your team.
LB Clarence Hicks UTSA 71
info: NA
pros: Back to back 90+ PFF pass rush grades, 13 sacks in 2021. Great athlete that can bend and get to the edge well.
cons: Played edge a lot although he wont do that in the NFL. On the smaller side, wont be a mike.
take: Hicks is an interesting prospect, he was used half of the time like an edge at 220 but he can fly around and create pressure as well as cover.
LB Jahad Woods Washington St 72
info: NA
pros: 2,876 career snaps. Flys around the field and attacks aggressively. Great in coverage, takes away routes well.
cons: Peaked in 2018 with a 79 grade and 88 in coverage. 6’1 225 undersized LB.
take: If Woods was 6’4 he’d be in consideration for a day 1 pick but he just doesn’t have much size.
LB Jojo Domann Nebraska 71
info:
pros: Solid coverage backer, a lot of experience in space. Tested and measurements were good enough. Solid at stopping screens and a good tackler.
cons: Tweener kind of, he played mostly slot cornerback so not a lot of LB experience. Unknown how he will translate to playing in the front 7
take: Domann is a complete projection. He played a mix of safety backer and slot corner so you don’t see many LB reps. He’s a solid athlete who can cover but it’s tbd if he can play in the box.
LB Keonte Hampton Jackson St 70
info: NA
pros: 90.5 PFF coverage grade. Good athlete who flys around looking to make plays.
cons: 16% missed tackle rate, he’s not playing to strong.

pros: 70+ tacking grade each year and 3 year starter. 2 time team captain. Plays hard and with solid acceleration to get to the ball. Has solid instinct and is always around the ball.
cons: Not the best size, 6’1 226 31 inch arms. Not going to play physical in the NFL, OL will dominate him.
take: Gemmel was a team captain and an instinctive player for the Tar Heels. The size isn’t there which will drop him down boards but he’s a solid player.
LB Olakunle Fatukasi Rutgers 70
info: NA
pros: 6’2 240, big LB. had a grade of 76 in 2019. Can take on blocks and play physical. Good tackler.

take: Fatukasi is a thumping LB that could play run defense snaps right now.
LB Luke Masterson Wake Forrest 70
info: NA
pros: 6’2 230 and played 2,225 career snaps. Moves really well on the field, can cover the seam well.
cons: Never graded above 64. Can be a tad late to react to a play and get caught in the mess.
take: Masterson has the size and movement skills to play in the NFL, he needs to react a little faster and he will be a force.
LB Zakoby McClain Auburn 69
info: NA
pros: Solid in run defense, can slip through OL and find windows. Solid athlete, can keep up with TE’s in coverage.
cons: On the smaller side, not a thumper. Not very aggressive, a little timid in his game. Misses too many tackles in space.
take: McClain is a tad undersized, he’s not an elite athlete either. He plays the run very well and can cover with his plus athleticism and has a lot of experience in the SEC. He’s worth a shot to bring in and compete.
LB Jack Cochrane South Dakota 69
info: NA
pros: 92.1 coverage grade and a multiple time team captain. 6’3 and moves well, has good length and coverage skills.
cons: Not an overly physical player, doesn’t tackle extremely well or take on blockers.
take: Cochrane was a great coverage linebacker in the FCS with his fluid movement and length, he could be a late round steal if he develops.
LB Hayden Henry Arkansas 69
info: NA
pros: Flys around to the ball, doesn’t shy away from contact and attacks downhill. 6’2 has some decent length to him
cons: One year starter and never graded above 65. On the slimmer side, can get beat by power.

LB James Skalski Clemson 69
info: NA
pros: He’s been the leader of Clemsons defense the last 3 years and graded solid too. Tough linebacker with solid play recognition and is a football guy.
cons: Not an athlete, misses tackles due to stiffness and lack of length.
take: SKalski is a leader and football guy, you want him on your football team. He’s just not a good athlete that will be limited.
LB Teddy Gallagher Costal Carolina 69
info: NA
pros: Was a team captain and had a mullet. Plays super hard and aggressive, flying downhill and shooting gaps.
cons: Can get eaten up by OL, not a long linebacker. Can struggle in coverage with length.
take: Gallagher didn’t grade the best but you can tell he does a great job reading the plays and attacking downhill. He may struggle because of his length but he was great for Costal Carolina.
LB Deontay Anderson Houston 69
info: NA
pros: Good athlete and 6’2 230. Can run down the seem very well.
cons: Graded as a 66, never was that dominate.

pros: All Academic team all 5 years. Sub 10% missed tackle rate. Graded 70+ each season. Solid athlete and decent size.
cons: Not a long linebacker and doesn’t play the run well, not a thumper.

cons: On the slimmer side, not going to be great in the box on power runs.

cons: 61 grade in 2021, dropped off from Maryland. Testing doesn’t translate on field, not good in space.

cons: Not the size to play as a strong run defender and take on OL. Would like to see more speed from an undersized LB.
take: Bernard had a good career at baylor and was a good student along with athlete. But, he left a lot to be desired on the field, he’s not decisive or that physical which will hurt his draft stock.

cons: Not a rangy player, short player without the greatest athleticism.

cons: Isn’t a fluid mover in space, lacks athleticism. Coverage isn’t great, eyes stuck in backfield.
