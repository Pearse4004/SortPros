RB Master Teague Ohio St 67
info: Teague committed to Ohio State after a successful high school career in Tennessee. He never was the lead back there but had 2 100+ carry seasons where he averaged just over 5 a carry. Teague was just another victim of a loaded Ohio state team.
pros: Stocky Strong build. Powerful runner that runs his feet. Not arm tackling him almost ever.
cons: Not much of a blocker. Not a lot of juice, speed and agility lacking. Never a lead back. No pass catching to speak of.
take: Teague is clearly a power back with not much else to offer past that. He will never be a 3 down lead back but could be a productive runner given opportunities.
