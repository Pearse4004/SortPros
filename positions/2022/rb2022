RB Master Teague Ohio St 67
info: Teague committed to Ohio State after a successful high school career in Tennessee. He never was the lead back there but had 2 100+ carry seasons where he averaged just over 5 a carry. Teague was just another victim of a loaded Ohio state team.
pros: Stocky Strong build. Powerful runner that runs his feet. Not arm tackling him almost ever.
cons: Not much of a blocker. Not a lot of juice, speed and agility lacking. Never a lead back. No pass catching to speak of.
take: Teague is clearly a power back with not much else to offer past that. He will never be a 3 down lead back but could be a productive runner given opportunities.
RB Tyler Allgeier BYU 71
info: Allgeier was the all-time leading rusher fir Kaiser High School in California. The power back brough his talents to BYU, he became the lead back when he was a junior. He had a very productive 2 years there rushing for 1.1k then 1.6k back to back years.
pros: Big strong back with a good build, 5’11 220. Runs through high tackles, is a load to bring down. Good pass protector, willing to take on blitzers.
cons: No twitch to his game, slow acceleration. Speed and agility are lacking as well, power back only.
take: Allgeier was an ultra productive back for BYU and has a lot of strength to his game. He isn’t a good athlete though and at only 220 you would want to see more explosiveness out of him. He could be a 3rd back on a team and fill in if needed and be used in short yardage.
RB James Cook Georgia 74
info: If the name Cook rings a bell you aren’t mistaken. James Cook is the younger brother of All-Pro RB Dalvin Cook and the apple didn’t fall far from the tree. He was highly rated recruited that wound up committing to Georgia over Florida State. He never got the lead back role while he was there but that’s because Georgia isn’t short in the talent department. His final year he ended with 700 yards and a national championship which is a great way to enter the NFL draft.
pros: Great top end speed, won’t get caught by a LB. Cutting ability is great, changes directions with ease. Great hands out of the backfield, could be a low end receiver. Great routes for a running back, sharp cuts.
cons: Never was a lead back and probably wont ever be. Doesn’t have the strength to run through anyone. Never had to block in pass pro.
take: Cook is your prototypical 3rd down back with great speed and great hands. He may not be your feature do it all back that play in short yardage situations or consistently block but he is a top tier athlete and a great change of pace.
RB Breece Hall Iowa St 77
info: Hall had a prolific career at Iowa St. Being a 4-star recruit coming out of Kansas he delivered on the hype racking up award after award and leading Iowa state to multiple very good years. He had a modest 900 yards his freshman year being named a freshman All-American. He followed that up with back to back Big 12 Offensive Player of the years and consensus All-Americans.
pros: Great vision, uses great patients to let blocks develop and hit openings in the defense. Great contact balance, runs through arm tackles and is always balanced. Good receiver for an RB. Bell cow, 590 touches in the 3 years.
cons: Not a great athlete, top speed, quickness and acceleration isn’t special. For the lack of explosiveness he also isn’t power back either.
take: Hall was the most productive back in college football for the last 3 years. There is a reason for that he is a talented back that has great vision with the ball. He may not have an elite physical trait to him but he will be a good starting RB.
RB Dameon Pierce Florida 76
info: Pierce was a 4-star recruit coming out of Bainbridge in Georgia where he had many SEC offers. He initially committed to Bama but flipped his commitment to Florida. He didn’t have the career he expected only starting 11 games in his career and never having a 600+ yard season.
pros: Bowling ball with the ball, a lot of power behind him. Has break away speed, not only a power back. Acceleration is great especially for size. Has some great catches on his tape.
cons: Was never very productive any year. Doesn’t make people miss, more of just a truck stick.
take: Pierce was criminally underused at Florida, he was an animal with the ball in his hands. He has incredible power along with great explosion and could easily be a featured back. If he showed that he could be a featured back he has the ability to be RB1.
RB Brian Robinson Alabama 73
info: Robinson is the typical Alabama story. He was a 4-star recruit out of Hillcrest in Tuscaloosa and was buried in the depth chart due to guys like Damien Harris and Najee Harris. He didn’t break the 100 carry mark until his senior season where he put together a great senior campaign. He got over 1300 yards and 14 TDs and was named to the All SEC 1st team and was a vital part of the top seeded bama team.
pros: Big back at 6’1 220. Runs with great physicality, always gets extra yardage after contact. Solid athlete for the size.
cons: Not very strong in pass pro. Only 1 year of starting and ran behind Alabamas OL. Not twitchy, not making people miss too much.
take: Robinson is definitely and NFL back, he has the size and strength to get a role in the NFL. He may not be the most electric back nor the fastest but he’s a good enough athlete to carry the load for a team if needed.
RB Isaiah Spiller Texas A&M 72
info: Spiller was a 4-star coming out of Klein Collins in Texas and stayed local by committing to A&M. He immediately became their starter and almost broke the 1k mark and was named a SEC All-Freshman. He eclipsed the 1k mark the next two yeats and was voted 2nd team All SEC.
pros: Good size, 6’1 215. Really good jump cuts, doesn’t lose much speed when he puts his foot in the ground. Production for 3 year and as a true freshman.
cons: Doesn’t have the power you want for 215. Doesn’t run through contact very well.
take: Spiller was a very productive running back for 3 straight years for the Aggies. He has the quickness to change directions very well but he’s lacking a trump card like power or speed. He can be a good back up in the NFL and pick up what is blocked well.
RB Kenneth Walker Michigan St 77
info: Walker was a 3 star back coming out of Arlington Tennessee and originally committed to Wake Forest. He ran for 579 yard in back to back years there before deciding to take his talents to Michigan State where he could be the featured back. He took the starting job and ran with it, rushing for over 1,600 yards and picked up the Doak Walker award for the nations best RB.
pros: Great change of direction and acceleration. Runs with great power for his size. Breaks a lot of tackles with his shiftiness. Bell cow back that produced every game his final year. Showed flashes of good hands.
cons: Not much receiving experience. Not strong in pass protection. Smaller frame to him.
take: Walker was a very productive back for Michigan State. He has everything you could want when he has the ball in his hand. He’s a good athlete, elusive and has power which should translate well to the NFL. He should be able to step in and be a day one starter.
RB Rachaad White Arizona St 69
info: White started his career at a JUCO (Mt San Antonio) where he was a dominate back and was rated as a top 3 JUCO back. He originally committed to UCLA before getting offered by Arizona St and flipping his commitment to them. He was great for the sun devils racking up 1000 yards on the ground and 450 through the air.
pros: 48 receptions in 2021, experienced out of the backfield and has good hands. Creative in the open field, hurdles and good shake to break defenders.
cons: Doesn’t add much in pass pro. Doesn’t run with much power. High cut RB that doesn’t have great change of direction skills.
take: White really came on in the second half of 2021 where he was a major contributor for the Sun Devils. He showed that he is great in open space and has great hands. If he can develop his pass pro he could be a very nice 3rd down back in the NFL.
RB Kyren Williams Notre Dame 77
info: Williams committed to Notre Dame after an impressive career in St Louis MO. He didn’t play much his true freshman season but his sophomore year he took the lead back roll and didn’t let go. He was a vital piece in Notre Dames run to the playoffs which may have earned him captainship his senior year. They may not have made the playoffs in 2021 but he still had an impressive season for the Irish.
pros: Best pass protecting back in the class. Great out of the backfield, hands are a plus. Shifty back, can shake dudes out of their shoes. Good contact balance, takes a lot to bring him down. Nasty stiff arm.
cons: Smaller back at sub 200. Not going to run many people over.
take: Williams is the most pro ready right now due to his pass pro. He’s going to be a great 3rd down back and has the ability to be an every down back.
RB Tyler Badie Missouri 74
info: Badie was a late bloomer in both HS and Missouri. In Highschool he went from 400 yards his junior year to over 1000 yards his senior year which got him a 3 star status. He immediately played for Missouri getting 400 yards and being named to the SEC all freshman team. He stayed around that level of production until his final year where he ran for over 1000 yards which led to him being voted 1st team ALL-SEC.
pros: Dense frame, all good weight on him. Low center of gravity, good contact balance and shifty ness. Great acceleration, he takes off in a hurry and nobody catches him.
cons: Not a lot of pass pro where he could struggle. Sub 200 lbs even though he has some power. 1 year full time starter.
take: Badie really helped himself his last year showing that he is dangerous to hit a home run on any given run. It is still to be determined if he can protect the passer and play on all downs with his weight but he’s a threat every time he has the ball.
RB Greg Bell San Diego St 68
info: Bell was went straight to juco out of Chula Vista Cal and attended Arizona Wester CC for 2 years and was a first team JUCO All American. This gained him an offer from Nebraska where he played 4 games but ultimately transferred to San Diego State after. He had a great 1st season where he was named a 2nd team All Mountain West selection and he did more of the same his final year, eclipsing 1000 yards and getting another 2nd team All Mountain West selection.
pros: Great burst at the line, can explode through a hole. Good vision, makes good cuts that can screw up pursuit. Willing to throw his body at an oncoming blitzer in pass pro.
cons: Thin frame that doesn’t run with a bunch of power. Not a tackle breaker, easily is taken down.
take: Bell has the tools to play in the NFL like size, athleticism and willingness to block. To be a contributor you would like to see a special trait that Bell doesn’t have. He could be a contributor but many RBs could do what he does.
RB Max Borghi Washington St 68
info: Borghi was a 3 star recruit out of Pomona in CO where he lead them to a 5A state tittle. He committed to Washington State and was an immediate contributor by getting 72 carries and 53 receptions. His Sophomore year he really turned it on, he had over 100 carries and a whopping 86 receptions which lead him to be viewed as a Doak Walker and Biletnikoff award contender. Unfortunately he didn’t play much in 2020 and had a less impressive senior year with either 16 receptions.
pros: Great pass catching out of the backfield. Deceptively athletic that can break contain and get to the edge.
cons: Not a strong runner or pass blocker. Played in a scheme that isn’t translatable to the NFL, so much open space.
take: Borghi would have to survive as a 3rd down back because of his receiving skills. Unfortunately he doesn’t have the pass blocking to go with it and isn’t great with the ball in his hand. He needs to add strength and block well to flourish in the NFL.
