S Kyle Hamilton Notre Dame 92
info: Hamilton by reports have been all business ever since playing for Marist in Atlanta. He was offered by most teams you could think of but he decided to go out of state and head to south bend. He immediately made a huge impact and was voted a freshman All-American and followed that up with another All-American performance his sophomore year. His final year showed more of the same before it was cut short due to a knee injury.
pros: Young and produced immediately. He has a good amount of power behind him. Sees plays develop in front of him. Great height and length. Burst is there, can accelerate well. Showed good mirroring/coverage abilities. Doesn’t miss many one-on-one tackles.
cons: Aggressive to a fault at times. Takes poor angles sometimes and misses easy tackles. A little slightly built at this point.
take: Hamilton is a versatile safety that can both play center field and in the box. He has all the ability in to be the best safety in the league with his versatility and size/speed.
S Jaquan Brisker Penn State 79
info: Brisker started his college career at Lakawana CC where he was a team captain and one of the best JUCO safety’s in the nation. He committed to Penn state where he put together a good college career. By his second year he was the starting safety for Penn State and by his final year he was a unanimous 1st team All American and Penn States Defensive Team MVP.
pros: Plays the position with good physicality. Good coverage player, understands route combos and sees the field well as a deep safety. Can play in the box and support the run. Can move all around the field, very versatile.
cons: Too many missed tackles, too aggressive coming up to the ball career. Not going to man up a slot receiver well, doesn’t have the athleticism to match up well. Under 200 lbs which will hurt him playing in the box. Stares at the quarterback to much and can lose the routes.
take: Brisker was a great player for Penn State and was highly regarded for good reason. He made great plays in coverage and is a very capable box player. He may not be an elite athlete but he’s a great football player and could start for most teams at safety.
