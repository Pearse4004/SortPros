S Kyle Hamilton Notre Dame 89
info: Hamilton by reports have been all business ever since playing for Marist in Atlanta. He was offered by most teams you could think of but he decided to go out of state and head to south bend. He immediately made a huge impact and was voted a freshman All-American and followed that up with another All-American performance his sophomore year. His final year showed more of the same before it was cut short due to a knee injury.
pros: Young and produced immediately. He has a good amount of power behind him. Sees plays develop in front of him. Great height and length. Burst is there, can accelerate well. Showed good mirroring/coverage abilities. Doesn’t miss many one-on-one tackles.
cons: Aggressive to a fault at times. Takes poor angles sometimes and misses easy tackles. A little slightly built at this point.

S Lewis Cine Georgia 84
info: Cine was one of the top safeties in the nation coming out of Trinity Christian School. He played in Massachusetts before that where he was the 2017 DPOY and he decided to commit to Georgia where he got starting experience year one. He became the full time starter his sophomore year and kept it rolling and was selected to the 1st team All SEC team and 3rd All American team.
pros: Fantastic measurables, 4.35 with a 11’1 broad at 6’2 200. Looking for blood when he comes down hill, hit power is excellent. Physical tackler, not getting bullied by anyone. Solid in coverage, doesn’t get beat badly ever and is very sound.
cons: Not going to be able to lock up a good tight end, not experienced in press man. Can play too deep in zone and left stuff up underneath too easily.
take: Cine was an underrated part of Georgias D, he in a monster in run support and solid in coverage. He has all the tools to be a great safety in the league and played very well at a young age.
S Jaquan Brisker Penn State 79
info: Brisker started his college career at Lakawana CC where he was a team captain and one of the best JUCO safety’s in the nation.

cons: Too many missed tackles, too aggressive coming up to the ball career. Not going to man up a slot receiver well, doesn’t have the athleticism to match up well. Under 200 lbs which will hurt him playing in the box. Stares at the quarterback to much and can lose the routes.
take: Brisker was a great player for Penn State and was highly regarded for good reason. He made great plays in coverage and is a very capable box player. He may not be an elite athlete but he’s a great football player and could start for most teams at safety.

cons: One year starter although it was a great year. Takes too long to react to the routes in front of him. Bad tackler, doesn’t see what he hits and lunges.

S Bryan Cook Cincinnati 75
info: NA
pros: Solid size, 6’1 206 and 32 inch arms. Sub 10% tackle rate his senior year. Ready to take on any ball carrier or blocker. Played cornerback so can matchup in the slot if needed. Good eyes and plays his responsibility well and with good instincts.

cons: Never had a good run defense season, max grade 64. Played a lot of nickel, not much free safety.

cons: Older prospect, 6th year senior. Drop off in grade in 2021, 79 to a 63 grade.
take: Turner should have declared last year, he had a 79 grade and a 5% missed tackle rate and all the accolades. He’s a good athlete with experience that played well for 5 years. He’s just never garnered the big time hype that whould get him on day two but he should be a solid NFL player.

take: Bolden has the measurables you are looking for in a safety, but the play doesn’t match up. He played high a lot and didn’t make many plays, without the fluid movement skills to cover deep. He will be solid on special teams but that’s his projection.
S Jack Koerner Iowa 70
info: NA
pros: 6 foot 204 and tested well at his pro day. He’s a solid deep free safety, plays sound and doesn’t lose leverage.

cons: Plays so robotic, looks like a terrible athlete on the field. Not a very instinctive player, plays at half speed and doesn’t trust what he’s seeing.

info: NA
pros: Solid pro day numbers, 4.41 40 6.65 3 cone and jumped 38 inches. Converted WR so has solid ball skills. Good on special teams.
