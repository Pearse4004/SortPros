S Kyle Hamilton Notre Dame 87
info: Hamilton by reports have been all business ever since playing for Marist in Atlanta. He was offered by most teams you could think of but he decided to go out of state and head to south bend. He immediately made a huge impact and was voted a freshman All-American and followed that up with another All-American performance his sophomore year.
pros: Young and produced immediately. Some of the better hit sticks from a college safety. Sees plays develop in front of him. Great height and length. Burst is there, can accelerate well. Showed good mirroring/coverage abilities.
cons: Aggressive to a fault. Takes poor angles sometimes and misses easy tackles. A little slightly built at this point.
takeaway: Hamilton is definitely more of your box thumping safety. He has all the ability in to be the best safety in the league but just needs to not take the bait some plays and maintain his assignment.
