S Kyle Hamilton Notre Dame 90
info: Hamilton by reports have been all business ever since playing for Marist in Atlanta. He was offered by most teams you could think of but he decided to go out of state and head to south bend. He immediately made a huge impact and was voted a freshman All-American and followed that up with another All-American performance his sophomore year. His final year showed more of the same before it was cut short due to a knee injury.
pros: Young and produced immediately. He has a good amount of power behind him. Sees plays develop in front of him. Great height and length. Burst is there, can accelerate well. Showed good mirroring/coverage abilities. Doesnâ€™t miss many one-on-one tackles.
cons: Aggressive to a fault. Takes poor angles sometimes and misses easy tackles. A little slightly built at this point.
take: Hamilton is a versatile safety that can both play center field and in the box. He has all the ability in to be the best safety in the league with his versatility and size/speed.
