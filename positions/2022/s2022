S Kyle Hamilton Notre Dame 89
info: Hamilton by reports have been all business ever since playing for Marist in Atlanta. He was offered by most teams you could think of but he decided to go out of state and head to south bend. He immediately made a huge impact and was voted a freshman All-American and followed that up with another All-American performance his sophomore year. His final year showed more of the same before it was cut short due to a knee injury.
pros: Young and produced immediately. He has a good amount of power behind him. Sees plays develop in front of him. Great height and length. Burst is there, can accelerate well. Showed good mirroring/coverage abilities. Doesn’t miss many one-on-one tackles.
cons: Aggressive to a fault at times. Takes poor angles sometimes and misses easy tackles. A little slightly built at this point.
take: Hamilton is a versatile safety that can both play center field and in the box. He has all the ability in to be the best safety in the league with his versatility and size/speed.
S Lewis Cine Georgia 84
info: Cine was one of the top safeties in the nation coming out of Trinity Christian School. He played in Massachusetts before that where he was the 2017 DPOY and he decided to commit to Georgia where he got starting experience year one. He became the full time starter his sophomore year and kept it rolling and was selected to the 1st team All SEC team and 3rd All American team.
pros: Fantastic measurables, 4.35 with a 11’1 broad at 6’2 200. Looking for blood when he comes down hill, hit power is excellent. Physical tackler, not getting bullied by anyone. Solid in coverage, doesn’t get beat badly ever and is very sound.
cons: Not going to be able to lock up a good tight end, not experienced in press man. Can play too deep in zone and left stuff up underneath too easily.
take: Cine was an underrated part of Georgias D, he in a monster in run support and solid in coverage. He has all the tools to be a great safety in the league and played very well at a young age.
S Jaquan Brisker Penn State 79
info: Brisker started his college career at Lakawana CC where he was a team captain and one of the best JUCO safety’s in the nation. He committed to Penn state where he put together a good college career. By his second year he was the starting safety for Penn State and by his final year he was a unanimous 1st team All American and Penn States Defensive Team MVP.
pros: Plays the position with good physicality. Good coverage player, understands route combos and sees the field well as a deep safety. Can play in the box and support the run. Can move all around the field, very versatile.
cons: Too many missed tackles, too aggressive coming up to the ball career. Not going to man up a slot receiver well, doesn’t have the athleticism to match up well. Under 200 lbs which will hurt him playing in the box. Stares at the quarterback to much and can lose the routes.
take: Brisker was a great player for Penn State and was highly regarded for good reason. He made great plays in coverage and is a very capable box player. He may not be an elite athlete but he’s a great football player and could start for most teams at safety.
S Scott Nelson Wisconsin 70
info: NA
pros: Ran a 4.38 a sub 4 shuttle and a 6.62 3 cone jumping 40 inches. Good size at 6’2 205. Flashes plays where he shows his speed.
cons: Plays so robotic, looks like a terrible athlete on the field. Not a very instinctive player, plays at half speed and doesn’t trust what he’s seeing.
take: If it wasn’t for a great pro day Nelson wouldn’t even be on a team. But, his numbers were so good a team should take the chance and see if they can develop him.
S Collin Wilder Wisconsin 70
info: NA
pros: Good aggression in the backend, ready to come downhill at any time. Quick reads, sees the play well and fires towards the ball.
cons: Small safety, although he’s willing to play the run in the NFL he will be physically overmatched.
take: Wilder may not have the size teams covet but he is a very good player. He’s quick, aggressive and instinctive and was the best safety on the team.
S Daniel Wright Alabama 65
info: NA
pros: One year of starting experience for bama, as well as a key special temaer.
cons: Never really got the playing time he needed in 5 years. Never graded above 65 for PFF.
take: Wright would be able to play special teams for a team, but he's not going to contribute much to a teams defense.
