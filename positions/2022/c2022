C Tyler Linderbaum Iowa 94
info: Linderbaum didn’t start out at center, he committed as a defensive lineman to the Hawkeyes. Early on he switched to OL where he and his friend Tristan Wirfs would train together which lead Wirfs to say linderbaum was the best OL he’s seen. Linderbaum has been the best center in college football for the past two seasons and this was recognized by him receiving the rimington award as well as Big 10 OL of the year.
pros: No OL can move the speed that he can. Unbelievable reach block ability. An absolute dawg in the run game, he will run you over. Gets to the second level better than anyone in football. Super strong for size, understands leverage.
cons: Not the ideal size for OL. Not experienced in one-on-one man blocking a nose guard which could be a weakness.
take: I’ve never seen as sure a thing on the OL as Linderbaum. He plays at such a different level that everyone else he makes it fun to watch the center position. He will be one of the best centers of all time mark those words.
C Luke Fortner Kentucky 70
info: Fortner is a 6th year player for Kentucky that was part of a solid offensive line playing with Darian Kennard. He was a team captain his 6th year and was named an Academic All American as well as 2nd team All SEC.
pros: Team leader as a captain. Wants to play physical.
cons: Really high cut for an interior lineman. A little stiff and doesn’t move great in space. Play strength got exposed against Jordan Davis and the rest of Georgia.
take: Fortner may have been a team leader and a smart guy but physically it isn’t there. I’d love to bring him into camp and see how he does but I’m not sure he can make it in the NFL.
