C Tyler Linderbaum Iowa 94
info: Linderbaum didn’t start out at center, he committed as a defensive lineman to the Hawkeyes. Early on he switched to OL where he and his friend Tristan Wirfs would train together which lead Wirfs to say linderbaum was the best OL he’s seen. Linderbaum has been the best center in college football for the past two seasons and this was recognized by him receiving the rimington award as well as Big 10 OL of the year.
pros: No OL can move the speed that he can. Unbelievable reach block ability. An absolute dawg in the run game, he will run you over. Gets to the second level better than anyone in football. Super strong for size, understands leverage.
cons: Not the ideal size for OL. Not experienced in one-on-one man blocking a nose guard which could be a weakness.
take: I’ve never seen as sure a thing on the OL as Linderbaum. He plays at such a different level that everyone else he makes it fun to watch the center position. He will be one of the best centers of all time mark those words.
