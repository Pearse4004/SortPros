C Tyler Linderbaum Iowa 90
info: Linderbaum didn’t start out at center, he committed as a defensive lineman to the Hawkeyes. Early on he switched to OL where he and his friend Tristan Wirfs would train together which lead Wirfs to say linderbaum was the best OL he’s seen. Linderbaum has been the best center in college football for the past two seasons and this was recognized by him receiving the rimington award as well as Big 10 OL of the year.
pros: No OL can move the speed that he can. Unbelievable reach block ability. An absolute dawg in the run game, he will run you over. Gets to the second level better than anyone in football. Super strong for size, understands leverage.
cons: Not the ideal size for OL. Not experienced in one-on-one man blocking a nose guard which could be a weakness.
take: I’ve never seen as sure a thing on the OL as Linderbaum. He plays at such a different level that everyone else he makes it fun to watch the center position. He will be one of the best centers of all time mark those words.
C Alec Lindstrom Boston College 76
info: NA
pros: Brother was very good. 4 straight years of 78+ PFF pass grades. Used to making calls at the line. Aggressive lineman, has the lineman mindset. Latches on and stays infront of the defender. Can anchor in pass pro well.
cons: Not ideal measurables, sub 300 pounds 32 inch arms and not great testing numbers. Trouble getting to the second level and blocking in space.
take: Lindstrom is the kind of lineman that everyone wants. He is nasty in the run game and gives it his all every play. He could start immediately although he is physically limited.
C Cam Jurgens Nebraska 73
info: NA
pros: His nickname is beef jerky. Good athlete, ran a 4.92 and has 33.5 inch arms. 3 year starter who made a massive leap his senior year. Can reach block very effectively with his athleticism. Very good mover in space, screen blocks are a plus.
cons: On the smaller side weighing in at 303. Started off his career with 2 40 PFF grades. Doesn’t control defenders once he starts to block them. Not a strong blocker, wont move anyone in the run game.
take: Jurgens is one of the most athletic lineman in the draft and it’s very apparent when he is in space. He struggles with power in the run game and can get thrown around in pass pro too much.
C James Empey BYU 72
info: NA
pros: 4 year starter and graded above 70 every time. Good in pass pro every year, picks stuff up well and moves well in space.
cons: Got hurt the last 2 years. Can struggle with power because his size and strength.
take: Empey had some good tape over the last 4 years for BYU, allowing only 24 total pressures. He’s going to struggle with some power rushers but could play center in the NFL.
C Luke Fortner Kentucky 71
info: Fortner is a 6th year player for Kentucky that was part of a solid offensive line playing with Darian Kennard. He was a team captain his 6th year and was named an Academic All American as well as 2nd team All SEC.
pros: Team leader as a captain. Wants to play physical.
cons: Really high cut for an interior lineman. A little stiff and doesn’t move great in space. Play strength got exposed against Jordan Davis and the rest of Georgia.
take: Fortner may have been a team leader and a smart guy but physically it isn’t there. I’d love to bring him into camp and see how he does but I’m not sure he can make it in the NFL.
C Dohnovan West Arizona St 71
info: NA
pros: Played 3 years and multiple positions. Under control at all times, smooth player. Young player still under 21 years old.
cons: Sub 300 pounds without great athletic testing numbers. Gets beat with power to easy and isn’t a great athlete to reach block.

C Michael Maietti Missouri 71
info: NA
pros: 4 year full time starter with 3,725 snaps. Graded as a 89.1 in 2021 and improved his last 3 years. Moves really well to seal off the second level.
cons: Smaller center prospect at 6’1 290. Going to struggle with stronger DL, not long are powerful.
take: Maietti is a very good center who played well in the SEC, getting to the second level in the run game and sealing defenders off. He will be limited do to his size, but he has done it at the highest college level.
C Jarrett Patterson Notre Dame 72
info: Patterson was a highly sought after recruit coming out of Mission Viejo in California. He choose to attend Notre Dame and put together a very nice career there. He was the starter his sophomore year and on for a dominate Notre Dame offensive line. His final year he was named a captain and acted as a leader for the team all year.
pros: Back to back grades around 80 at Notre dame and was a 3 year starter. Good in pass pro, can slide side to side well and uses his hands well.
cons: Not the strongest center, has trouble playing low and driving guys off the ball.
take: Patterson is a leader and a solid OL that got the job done for the Irish. He is a steady force in pass pro but isn’t going to flash dominate reps.
C Chris Owens Alabama 70
info: NA
pros: Versatile, has played game snaps at every position on the OL. 4 star prospect that went to Alabama. Smooth in pass pro, doesn’t lunge or play off balance.

take: Owens is a versatile lineman who played for the best college program this decade. He just doesn’t have the physical skills et to be a good starting NFL lineman, he will probably live as a back up swing lineman.
C Luke Wattenberg Washington 70
info: NA
pros: 5 years of starting experience at tackle guard and center. Long arms for an interior lineman, 34 inches. Great at using his arms to keep defenders off him hand seal out lineman.
cons: He’s very limited because his anchor, Oti bull rushed him too easily. Won’t be able to move anyone in the run game.

cons: Not the most powerful player, gets pushed back in the pocket too much. Not a quick athlete for the lack of power he has.

cons: Physically limited, not the advanced athlete to make up for his strength deficiency.

cons: Small center listed at 6’2 295. Has a tough time in pass pro with his strength and length being a limiting factor.

info: NA
pros: 4 year starter at center and never graded below 60. Walk on turned starter, works hard. Solid mover, can get to 2nd level well. Solid in pass pro even with smaller size.
