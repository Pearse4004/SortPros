EDGE Kayvon Thibodeaux Oregon 90
info: Coming out of Oaks Christian in California Thibodeaux was a widely recruited 5-star prospect with all the tools you could want in an edge player. He’s 6’5 250 freaky athlete that came to Oregon in 2019 and immediately made an impact putting up 9 sacks and garnering every freshman award he could. He followed that up with another good season in 2020 and was named to the All-American team for his efforts. 2021 he did more of the same, he was named to the All-PAC 12 first team and dominated all year.
pros: Great build for the position, looks like he was made in madden. Uses length well, gets his hands on you first and has a mean long arm. Mad man trying to get the quarterback when not tired. The get off is far better than anyone else on the field. Beat Vera-Tucker with some nice speed rushes. Uses hands well on predetermined pass rush moves. Goes for the ball very well.
cons: Tackles can push him around in the run game. No feel for coverage at all. Bend isn’t a strength for him. Not very good at hand fighting. Not the greatest agility.
take: Thibodeaux is next in line for “generational talent” being 6’5 250 and having unbelievable burst and length. He came in as a freshman and immediately produced and has become the most impressive rusher in all of college football. If a team wants to upgrade their rush he will step right in and make an impact.
EDGE Aidan Hutchinson Michigan 93
info: Hutchinson was a stud playing at Divine Child in Michigan where he viewed as a top recruit in Michigan. He committed to his home state college where he played as a true freshman. His junior year he got some starts but unfortunately he fractured his leg and missed the rest of that year. He came back with a vengeance his senior year racking up 13 sacks in the regular season and beating Ohio State getting double digit pressures. He was named first team All-Big 10 and was the best defensive player in the country.
pros: Great Build for the position. Murdered the Ohio State tackles all game. Some of the best hand usage I’ve seen in college football. Has a hist of moves to beat tackles and get hands off him. Has good bend. Holds up against the run well. High motor, many pressures come because he didn’t give up. Hand placement is great. Timed a lot of snaps to get a good jump.
cons: He’s no freak athlete, definitely not an elite athlete. Penn States tackles did a good job against him.
take: Aidan Hutchinson will be a good if not great edge rusher in the NFL. He has shown all the skill needed to be a successful pass rusher and can play both the run and pass very well.
EDGE George Karlaftis Purdue 89
info: Karalaftis didn’t start playing football until he was in 8th grade after moving from Greece to the US. He immediately became an impact player and was rated as a 4 star recruit from all major recruiting sites. He was invited to the Army All American bowl where he was named defensive player of the year. He immediately got playing time as a freshman and was named to the Freshman All American team. He followed that up his junior year be being voted first team All Big 10 and putting an impressive season together that was affected by covid.
pros: Great size to his frame. Made an impact as a young player and played well as an underclassmen. Uses his hands extremely well to get blockers off him. Wide variety of pass rush moves that win. Good bull rush. Times up snaps well. Strong in the run game. Rushed from many different spots.
cons: Isn’t an elite athlete. Doesn’t have top end bend. Looks to guess in run game every once in a while.
take: Karalaftis is a very impressive edge rusher as well as a strong defender in the run game. He does everything at a high level and is expected to translate to the NFL. He will never be a Myles Garrett but with is ability he will be a productive edge player.
EDGE Tyreke Smith Ohio St 70
info: Smith was a hometown hero for the buckeyes, after dominating at Cleveland Heights he committed to Ohio State. He saw action immediately as a true freshman which is impressive given the talent they have had. He never really produced any big numbers though as he finished his career with 8 total sacks.
pros: Loves to hand fight and get the OL off of him when he pass rushes. Solid athlete for the defensive end position. Long arms to keep defenders off. Very good pass rush win rate.
cons: He had no real pass rush plan, just to get the hands off him. No power to his game, no bull rush and mediocre at holding an edge. Slim Frame for a EDGE, needs to really bulk up but already is a senior.
take: Smith has some tools that are good for an edge player but he really lacks the size to be contributing to an NFL team. A team could take him late and put some size on him and coach him up to be a solid player though.
EDGE David Ojabo Michigan 84
info: Ojabo has now played football for 5 years in his life and he absolutely dominated. He is originally from Nigeria and decided to pick up football his junior year and immediately showed that he was a special athlete. He committed to Michigan coming out of New Jersey and didn’t get playing time until his junior year. That junior year he showed out, alongside Hutchinson he was named 1st team All Big 10 getting 7 sacks (11 per ESPN).
pros: Great Length, keeps blockers away from his body. Has a great swipe/rip and dip move. Counters with a nice spin move so not just one trick. Good build, 6’5 250 with room for more mass.
cons: Not much of a run defender, gets moved too easy. No bull rush to his game, although it can be added. One year of tape.
take: Ojabo had a great opening season to his career, he was a great 2nd rusher to Hutchinson. He may not be fully developed at this point but there is a lot about his game to get excited about.
EDGE Arnold Ebiketie Penn St 81
info: Ebiketie broke out his senior year at temple which allowed him a shot to play as a grad transfer at Penn State. His final “COVID” year had him named an All AAC 2nd team member getting 4 sacks inf 350 pass rushes. He continued his play at Penn State getting 9.5 sacks and was named 1st team all big 10.
pros: Has the combination of speed and speed to power. Great inside counter with a hand swipe to the inside. Good at setting an edge and getting blockers off his body.
cons: Only produced once he was an older player in football. Isn’t an elite athlete at the edge position. Plays too high at times.
take: Ebiketie showed that his last year wasn’t a fluke, He dominated Big 10 tackles. He showed that he has the ability to win with speed power and a counter. Although he’s no Oweh or freak athlete he dominated tackles game in and game out.
EDGE Drake Jackson USC 75
info: Jackson came in to USC ready to play out of Centennial HS in California. He immediately started for the trojans where he got 5.5 sacks and was name All Pac 12 2nd team and Freshman All American. He did more of the same his second year and slightly improved his junior year where he was also voted 2nd team All Pac 12.
pros: Relentless to the ball, has one thing on his mind and that’s to get the ball. Good speed rush and solid flexibility.
cons: Thin frame and not much strength. No real pass rush moves, just tries to get around the defender.
take: Drake Jackson has been a solid player for the Trojans and graded well for PFF. His size and strength isn’t NFL ideal though which means a team would need to develop him and he’s not going to produce early.
