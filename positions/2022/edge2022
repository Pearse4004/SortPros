EDGE Aidan Hutchinson Michigan 93
info: Hutchinson was a stud playing at Divine Child in Michigan where he viewed as a top recruit in Michigan. He committed to his home state college where he played as a true freshman. His junior year he got some starts but unfortunately he fractured his leg and missed the rest of that year. He came back with a vengeance his senior year racking up 13 sacks in the regular season and beating Ohio State getting double digit pressures. He was named first team All-Big 10 and was the best defensive player in the country.
pros: Great Build for the position. Murdered the Ohio State tackles all game. Some of the best hand usage I’ve seen in college football. Has a hist of moves to beat tackles and get hands off him. Has good bend. Holds up against the run well. High motor, many pressures come because he didn’t give up. Hand placement is great. Timed a lot of snaps to get a good jump.
cons: He’s no freak athlete, definitely not an elite athlete. Penn States tackles did a good job against him.
take: Aidan Hutchinson will be a good if not great edge rusher in the NFL. He has shown all the skill needed to be a successful pass rusher and can play both the run and pass very well.
EDGE Kayvon Thibodeaux Oregon 91
info: Coming out of Oaks Christian in California Thibodeaux was a widely recruited 5-star prospect with all the tools you could want in an edge player. He’s 6’5 250 freaky athlete that came to Oregon in 2019 and immediately made an impact putting up 9 sacks and garnering every freshman award he could. He followed that up with another good season in 2020 and was named to the All-American team for his efforts. 2021 he did more of the same, he was named to the All-PAC 12 first team and dominated all year.
pros: Great build for the position, looks like he was made in madden. Uses length well, gets his hands on you first and has a mean long arm. Mad man trying to get the quarterback when not tired. The get off is far better than anyone else on the field. Beat Vera-Tucker with some nice speed rushes. Uses hands well on predetermined pass rush moves. Goes for the ball very well.
cons: Tackles can push him around in the run game. No feel for coverage at all. Bend isn’t a strength for him. Not very good at hand fighting.
take: Thibodeaux is next in line for “generational talent” being 6’5 250 and having unbelievable burst and length. He came in as a freshman and immediately produced and has become the most impressive rusher in all of college football. If a team wants to upgrade their rush he will step right in and make an impact.
EDGE George Karlaftis Purdue 88
info: Karalaftis didn’t start playing football until he was in 8th grade after moving from Greece to the US. He immediately became an impact player and was rated as a 4 star recruit from all major recruiting sites. He was invited to the Army All American bowl where he was named defensive player of the year. He immediately got playing time as a freshman and was named to the Freshman All American team. He followed that up his junior year be being voted first team All Big 10 and putting an impressive season together that was affected by covid.
pros: Great size to his frame. Made an impact as a young player and played well as an underclassmen. Uses his hands extremely well to get blockers off him. Wide variety of pass rush moves that win. Good bull rush. Times up snaps well. Strong in the run game. Rushed from many different spots.
cons: Isn’t an elite athlete. Doesn’t have top end bend. Looks to guess in run game every once in a while.
take: Karalaftis is a very impressive edge rusher as well as a strong defender in the run game. He does everything at a high level and is expected to translate to the NFL. He will never be a Myles Garrett but with is ability he will be a productive edge player.
EDGE Jermain Johnson Florida St 87
info: Johnson is an interesting story, he came out of Eden Prairie in Minnesota with a 1.9 gpa so when to Independence Community College which was featured on Last Chance U. For some reason they didn’t feature him but he was the top juco recruit and committed to Georgia. He never could crack the starting lineup at star studed Georgia so he transferred again to Florida State. He broke out there getting 12 sacks his final year and got the most 1st team All ACC Votes.
pros: Great hesitation-swipe-rip move around tackles. Good length, gets hands on lineman and keeps them away. Good bust off the line, gets in the backfield fast. Good build for an edge 6’5 260. Sets a nice edge and doesn’t get moved.
cons: Doesn’t have an elite trait to fall back on.
take: Johnson went to the only place in the country that he couldn’t start immediately. He showed at Florida State though that he is the real deal and has everything you want in an edge player. He may not be the elite player that teams love at edge but he certainly is a good prospect with very little limitations.
EDGE Travon Walker Georgia 86
info: Walker was a 5 star recruit out of Upson-Lee where he was dominate and commited to his home state Georgia Bulldogs. He got immediate playing time as a freshman where he was named to the freshman all American team. He never had a fantastic season but he did end on a high note after winning the national championship for the Bulldogs.
pros: Built in a lab, 6’5 270 ran a 4.5 40, 6.89 3 cone and has 35+ inch arms. Great against the run, very strong and long arms. Bull rush is easy for him with his size and length.
cons: Wasn’t a dominate rusher in college, more of a toolsy player. Raw pass rusher without many reps, Georgia liked to stunt and blitz off the edge. Unknown if he can get the edge and bend around.
take: Walker is a certified freak show, Georgia didn’t lack in the DL department this year. He is the edge prospect you dream up of but he never had to develop his pass rush moves. He needs to continue to work on his pass rush moves but he could be a dominate pass rusher given time.
EDGE David Ojabo Michigan 78
info: Ojabo has now played football for 5 years in his life and he absolutely dominated. He is originally from Nigeria and decided to pick up football his junior year and immediately showed that he was a special athlete. He committed to Michigan coming out of New Jersey and didn’t get playing time until his junior year. That junior year he showed out, alongside Hutchinson he was named 1st team All Big 10 getting 7 sacks (11 per ESPN).
pros: Great Length, keeps blockers away from his body. Has a great swipe/rip and dip move. Counters with a nice spin move so not just one trick. Good build, 6’5 250 with room for more mass.
cons: Not much of a run defender, gets moved too easy. No bull rush to his game, although it can be added. One year of tape. Tore his achilles on his pro day
take: Ojabo had a great opening season to his career, he was a great 2nd rusher to Hutchinson. He may not be fully developed at this point but there is a lot about his game to get excited about.
EDGE Sam Williams Ole Miss 81
info: NA
pros: Great athlete, good size at 6’4 260 with a 4.46 40. Got 13 sacks his final year with 61 total pressures. Very good first step, in the backfield in a hurry. Can win with both speed and power. Uses his hands well when rushing, can get OL hands off him well. Has the bend to beat tackles outside.
cons: Not the strongest against the run game. Doesn’t look like he even tries to play the run correct, lets them right into his pads.
take: Williams is a very talented pass rusher, he is the most slept on edge prospect in this draft. His issues include playing the run and a single year of pass rush production, but he’s physically gifted and will be a solid rusher.
EDGE Cameron Thomas San Diego St 79
info: Thomas was a 3 star 6’5 edge player coming out of Carlsbad California and somehow was only recruited by San Diego State. He proved that it was a mistake, by his 2nd year he was a 1st team all mountain west team and was for the next 2 years as well.
pros: Great size for an edge, especially with his movement skills. He has shown he can rush from both edge and interior. Great hands, swims rips and swipes OL hands away and easily gets buy them. Great power and extension, keeps blockers off him easily.
cons: Didn’t play top competition. Not an elite bender around the edge, he’s not an elite athlete
take: Thomas may be the steal of the draft, he has shown he can rush at a high level for 3 straight years. He can do it all, has the size and athleticism to be a great edge and already has shown refinement in pass rushing
EDGE Arnold Ebiketie Penn St 79
info: Ebiketie broke out his senior year at temple which allowed him a shot to play as a grad transfer at Penn State. His final “COVID” year had him named an All AAC 2nd team member getting 4 sacks inf 350 pass rushes. He continued his play at Penn State getting 9.5 sacks and was named 1st team all big 10.
pros: Has the combination of speed and speed to power. Great inside counter with a hand swipe to the inside. Good at setting an edge and getting blockers off his body. Has a nice speed rush to his game.
cons: Only produced once he was an older player in football. Isn’t an elite athlete at the edge position. Plays too high at times.
take: Ebiketie showed that his last year wasn’t a fluke, He dominated Big 10 tackles. He showed that he has the ability to win with speed power and a counter. Although he’s no Oweh or freak athlete he dominated tackles game in and game out.
EDGE Deangelo Malone Western Kentucky 77
info: Malone has had success his entire career, in high school he won a 3A state championship in Georgia but still wasn’t heavily recruited. He went to Western Kentucky and had a solid first two years then exploded his junior year and won Conference USA player of the year. He never had that double digit sack season again but he was an ultra productive player for them.
pros: Explosive athlete, moves at a different speed. Can win with speed and bend the edge. Quick twitch inside move to counter speed.
cons: Not a strong player, run defense needs to improve and put on more muscle. Played against low level competition.
take: I don’t know how Malone was a 2 star recruit but that was a mistake, not many 6’4 250 pounders can move like he does. If a team adds some strength to him he could be a great edge player.
EDGE Boye Mafe Minnesota 77
info: Boye didn’t have many offers after his senior season in Minnesota so he went to a Minnesota camp where he drew attention and was offered to join the Golden Gophers. He has been a steady contributor to the team after his redshirt freshman year which lead to his best season as a 5th year senior. He was a team captain and he got 7 sacks and was named 3rd team All Big 10.
pros: Great athlete with an explosive get off. High motor player that gives it 100%. Good length and build as a 3-4 backer.
cons: Doesn’t have the play strength to hold up in the run or walk tackles back. Doesn’t have a refined pass set, relies on athleticism.
take: Mafe has all the tools you want in an edge rusher, he has the motor and athleticism. The issue is his strength and development which is a real concern because it’s his 5th year. He will at least be a good candidate for a special teams player at the worst.
EDGE Nik Bonitto Oklahoma 76
info: NA
pros: 3 year starter that improved every year. He had back to baack 92+ PFF pass rush grades. Super quick rusher, burns tackles with quick inside moves. Can bend around the edge well, good get off and bend.
cons: Doesn’t have the ideal size, 6’3 with 32 inch arms. Weak in the run game, will get bullied. No power rush to his game, never attempted to.
take: Bonitto is a pass rush specialist, he’s been a great rusher in college but never showed out in the run game. He has the quickness to be a good pass rusher but not the strength to be an every down player.
EDGE Amare Barno Virginia Tech 75
info: Barno out of Blythewood South Carolina went the JUCO route before committing to Virginia Tech. He didn’t play in 2019 when he first got there as he wasn’t cut out for linebacker. He moved to positions and saw much more success getting 6 sacks his first year playing edge.
pros: Good length, 6’6 and looks long. Moves very well in space, change of direction and acceleration. Gets off the ball very well, usually the first player up field. My guy ran a 4.36 which is absurd.
cons: Doesn’t have much strength to his game, Thin frame right now. No great pass rush moves, doesn’t have the power and doesn’t use his hands well.
take: Barno is an interesting prospect, he’s very athletic and long which are two things you look for in an edge. If a team develops him and adds size he could turn into a really good pro.
EDGE Dominique Robinson Miami OH 75
info: NA
pros: Good edge makeup, 6’5 260 and can jump over 40 inches with solid bench and 40 numbers. Former wide receiver that switched to edge in 2020. Wins well with speed, good hand swipe and bend. Played great for an edge that only has 2 years of experience.
cons: Not many snaps at edge over his career, pretty raw still. A little thin, has trouble setting a hard edge. Not sure if he can win with power, may only bee a “speed” rusher. Not many pass rush moves, basically just hand swipe.
take: Robinson is one of the long smooth edge defenders that can win around the edge. He hasn’t played there too long but he has been very solid and rushed the passer well.
EDGE Drake Jackson USC 75
info: Jackson came in to USC ready to play out of Centennial HS in California. He immediately started for the trojans where he got 5.5 sacks and was name All Pac 12 2nd team and Freshman All American. He did more of the same his second year and slightly improved his junior year where he was also voted 2nd team All Pac 12.
pros: Relentless to the ball, has one thing on his mind and that’s to get the ball. Good speed rush and solid flexibility.
cons: Thin frame and not much strength. No real pass rush moves, just tries to get around the defender.
take: Drake Jackson has been a solid player for the Trojans and graded well for PFF. His size and strength isn’t NFL ideal though which means a team would need to develop him and he’s not going to produce early.
EDGE Myjai Sanders Cincinnati 74
info: Sanders was a 3 star recruit coming out of Jacksonville FL and passed on offers from Ole Miss and Washington State to join the bearcats and become a staple of their dominate run. He saw playing time his freshman year and was a full time starter by his sophomore year. His Junior and Senior year were impressive as he was a Bednarik semi finalist and All AAC both years.
pros: Long arms to keep blockers away. Great pass rush moves using hand swipes. A few reps of great explosion off the ball when he’s guessing the snap. Motor is there, always trying to get in the play. Not bad against the run given his frame.
cons: Not a great athlete. Don’t see much twitch or quickness to his game. A slender frame that will hurt him holding up against NFL run blocking. Not much bend at the top of rushes, doesn’t scare with a speed rush.
take: Sanders had a very productive career at Cinci due to his length motor and ability to win with hands. He isn’t the elite athlete that you would like at the edge but he should be able to contribute in the NFL.
EDGE Josh Paschal Kentucky 73
info: Paschal was a 4 star recruit out of Good Counsel in Maryland. He committed to Kentucky and played there for 6 years. In 2018 he was diagnosed with malignant melanoma and received treatment for it which explains his down year in 2018. From 2019 on he was a team captain for them and was named 2nd team All SEC after a 90 graded PFF season.
pros: Plays great run defense as an edge, can’t block him with a college TE. Versatile pass rusher, has won from the inside and out. Showed pretty good play recognition his senior year which allowed him to make more plays. Uses a variety of moves to beat defenders 1v1.
cons: Doesn’t have good length for the edge position. His burst off the line is pretty average. Isn’t a plus NFL athlete and at the edge that will hurt him.
take: Paschal was a good college player that may not translate to the NFL well. He doesn’t win with his athleticism and has some trouble holding up against power. He’s a guy because of intangibles that you would take a chance on but he may not ever be a good/great pass rusher.
EDGE Kingsley Enagbare South Carolina 74
info: Enagbore was a 4 star coming out of Hapeville Charter in Atlanta Georgia. He immediately found playing time at South Carolina and only got better from there. By his Junior year he was a full time starter and was named 1st team All SEC by the coaches. His senior year he didn’t get as much production or recognition but his PFF substantially went up.
pros: Good size and length for an edge, 6’4 260. Solid pass rush repertoire, has one in a variety of ways. Good change of direction skills, can sink his hips and accelerate.
cons: Didn’t play strong in the run game, got bullied too often. Isn’t a very good speed rusher, don’t see him get the edge and bend well.
take: Enagbare stands out when you look at South Carolinas defense. He’s a big athletic edge that has made some nice plays for them but ultimately he’s been inconsistent. He gets pushed around to much and shut down in his rush too much as well to draft him highly.
EDGE Esezi Otomewo Minnesota 72
info: Otomewo wasn’t recruited heavily which in my opinion was a mistake. He’s a big physical edge guy that is a solid athlete. He committed to Minnesota where he was named Scout team player of the year and Defensive Freshman of the year for the Gophers. He started at the end of his career never rally racking up sacks but being a solid player for the Gophers.
pros: Big strong edge defender. Strong at point of impact, doesn’t get moved easily and con bull rush. Good get off, gets on the backfield fast. Showed a nice inside swim against OSU.
cons: No flexibility shown in his film, never speed rushed. No production in the passing game, not much to offer.
take: Otomewo will definitely set a good edge for your team, He’s 6’6 280 and has strong hands. He’s never going to be a good pass rusher but could develop into a solid one meaning he would be a good starter.
EDGE Tyreke Smith Ohio St 71
info: Smith was a hometown hero for the buckeyes, after dominating at Cleveland Heights he committed to Ohio State. He saw action immediately as a true freshman which is impressive given the talent they have had. He never really produced any big numbers though as he finished his career with 8 total sacks.
pros: Loves to hand fight and get the OL off of him when he pass rushes. Solid athlete for the defensive end position. Long arms to keep defenders off. Very good pass rush win rate.
cons: He had no real pass rush plan, just to get the hands off him. No power to his game, no bull rush and mediocre at holding an edge. Slim Frame for a EDGE, needs to really bulk up but already is a senior.
take: Smith has some tools that are good for an edge player but he really lacks the size to be contributing to an NFL team. A team could take him late and put some size on him and coach him up to be a solid player though.
EDGE Christopher Allen Alabama 71
info: NA
pros: Played well in the 10 snaps he had his final year. Has an NFL build, 6’3.5 241 and 33 inch arms and looks athletic. Looks stout in the run game, muscular frame. Has the athleticism to rush the passer well.
cons: Injury cut short his senior season after 10 snaps. Never really seen him do anything because of injuries.
take: Allen may be the biggest unknown in the class because his injuries. He certainly looks the part and is a good athlete which could develop to a good edge rusher.
EDGE Zachary Carter Florida 70
info: Carter was a 4 star recruit out of Hillsborough in Tampa FL and had an offer from essentially every big time program in the country. He has gradually earned a greater role and was a mainstay by his redshirt senior year and notched 8 sacks.
pros: Versatile, can rush from the interior and edge at a high level. Good length to him, can keep run blockers away and has a good long arm. Can set a good edge. Good get off and can penetrate gaps.
cons: Can’t hold up in the run game on the interior. Not a good athlete for the edge position, just average.
take: Carter is an interesting player, he played both Edge and DL and had flashes at both but isn’t elite at either. He’s a good pass rusher though and has shown it from both spots which makes him a valuable piece to move around.
EDGE Isaiah Thomas Oklahoma 70
info: Thomas shouldn’t be confused with the baskeball player Isaiah Thomas, he is 8 inches taller and 80 pounds heavier. He was a 4 star recruit who committed to his home town sooners and was a 2 year starter for them notching 8 sacks on both seasons. He was named All Big 12 twice and was a force on the talented Sooners DL.
pros: Good length and power for an edge. Has nice inside moves, spin and swim. Good get off and can penetrate fast.
cons: No flexibility to get an edge. Bad athlete for the position. A bit of a tweener with no elite traits at either.
take: Thomas may have had 8 sacks but they weren’t to impressive, Oklahoma loved to run stunts to confuse OL. He has some good get off and quick moves but he doesn’t have much upside.
EDGE Kyron Johnson Kansas 69
info: NA
pros: Insane athlete, ran a 4.36 40 and jumped 40 inches at 231 pounds. Had a breakout senior year with 6 sacks and 39 total pressures including 4 fumbles.
cons: Very small to be playing edge at 6 foot 231 pounds. Didn’t break out until his 5th year at edge.
take: Johnson doesn’t have much power to his game or moves but he’s an elite athlete. He’s nice to have as a late round pick and see if you can use him in anyway because he’s a different player.
EDGE Micheal Clemons Texas A&M 68
info: Clemson had a long road to where he is now, he started out at JUCO (Cisco Junior College) and was a top defensive JUCO prospect after that year. He committed to A&M and got playing time immediately. By 2019 he was a starter and had a good season through the first 5 games if 2020 until a season ending injury, he was still named Defensive MVP that year for the Aggies. In 2021 he came back and did more of the same a team captain and defensive MVP.
pros: Good length, long arms that can help with a one arm (long arm) rush. Relentless rusher, great effort.
cons: Doesn’t have much strength to his game, struggled in the run game. Not a good athlete, moves slow and isn’t flexible.
take: Clemons is a solid player that seemed to be a team leader at A&M. He’s an edge with not much athleticism or strength so it will be hard for him in the NFL.
EDGE Noah Burks Wisconsin 67
info: NA
pros: Violent hands, good initial impact setting the edge. Good at block shedding, can throw tight ends off of him. Decent in coverage, looks like a fluid athlete
cons: Doesn’t have good length for an edge. No pass rush production.
take: Burks was a solid edge setter with heavy hands and violent moves to shed blockers. But, he doesn’t have the pass rush or length to be an NFL edge.
