EDGE Kayvon Thibodeaux Oregon 90
info: Coming out of Oaks Christian in California Thibodeaux was a widely recruited 5-star prospect with all the tools you could want in an edge player. He’s 6’5 250 freaky athlete that came to Oregon in 2019 and immediately made an impact putting up 9 sacks and garnering every freshman award he could. He followed that up with another good season in 2020 and was named to the All-American team for his efforts.
pros: Great build for the position, looks like he was made in madden. Uses length well, gets his hands on you first and has a mean long arm. Variety of pass rush moves and not a one trick pony. Mad man trying to get the quarterback when not tired. The get off is far better than anyone else on the field. Beat Vera-Tucker with some nice speed rushes.
cons: Although he has many, his rush moves seem not refined. Tackles can push him around in the run game. No feel for coverage at all. Bend isn’t a strength for him. Not very good at hand fighting.
takeaway: Thibodeaux is next in line for “generational talent” being 6’5 250 and having unbelievable burst and length. He came in as a freshman and immediately produced and has become the most impressive rusher in all of college football. If a team wants to upgrade their rush he will step right in and make an impact.
