EDGE Kayvon Thibodeaux Oregon 90
info: Coming out of Oaks Christian in California Thibodeaux was a widely recruited 5-star prospect with all the tools you could want in an edge player. He’s 6’5 250 freaky athlete that came to Oregon in 2019 and immediately made an impact putting up 9 sacks and garnering every freshman award he could. He followed that up with another good season in 2020 and was named to the All-American team for his efforts. 2021 he did more of the same, he was named to the All-PAC 12 first team and dominated all year.
pros: Great build for the position, looks like he was made in madden. Uses length well, gets his hands on you first and has a mean long arm. Mad man trying to get the quarterback when not tired. The get off is far better than anyone else on the field. Beat Vera-Tucker with some nice speed rushes. Uses hands well on predetermined pass rush moves. Goes for the ball very well.
cons: Tackles can push him around in the run game. No feel for coverage at all. Bend isn’t a strength for him. Not very good at hand fighting. Not the greatest agility.
take: Thibodeaux is next in line for “generational talent” being 6’5 250 and having unbelievable burst and length. He came in as a freshman and immediately produced and has become the most impressive rusher in all of college football. If a team wants to upgrade their rush he will step right in and make an impact.
EDGE Aidan Hutchinson Michigan 93
info: Hutchinson was a stud playing at Divine Child in Michigan where he viewed as a top recruit in Michigan. He committed to his home state college where he played as a true freshman. His junior year he got some starts but unfortunately he fractured his leg and missed the rest of that year. He came back with a vengeance his senior year racking up 13 sacks in the regular season and beating Ohio State getting double digit pressures. He was named first team All-Big 10 and was the best defensive player in the country.
pros: Great Build for the position. Murdered the Ohio State tackles all game. Some of the best hand usage I’ve seen in college football. Has a hist of moves to beat tackles and get hands off him. Has good bend. Holds up against the run well. High motor, many pressures come because he didn’t give up. Hand placement is great. Timed a lot of snaps to get a good jump.
cons: He’s no freak athlete, definitely not an elite athlete. Penn States tackles did a good job against him.
take: Aidan Hutchinson will be a good if not great edge rusher in the NFL. He has shown all the skill needed to be a successful pass rusher and can play both the run and pass very well.
EDGE George Karlaftis Purdue 89
info: Karalaftis didn’t start playing football until he was in 8th grade after moving from Greece to the US. He immediately became an impact player and was rated as a 4 star recruit from all major recruiting sites. He was invited to the Army All American bowl where he was named defensive player of the year. He immediately got playing time as a freshman and was named to the Freshman All American team. He followed that up his junior year be being voted first team All Big 10 and putting an impressive season together that was affected by covid.
pros: Great size to his frame. Made an impact as a young player and played well as an underclassmen. Uses his hands extremely well to get blockers off him. Wide variety of pass rush moves that win. Good bull rush. Times up snaps well. Strong in the run game. Rushed from many different spots.
cons: Isn’t an elite athlete. Doesn’t have top end bend. Looks to guess in run game every once in a while.
take: Karalaftis is a very impressive edge rusher as well as a strong defender in the run game. He does everything at a high level and is expected to translate to the NFL. He will never be a Myles Garrett but with is ability he will be a productive edge player.
EDGE Tyreke Smith Ohio St 70
info: Smith was a hometown hero for the buckeyes, after dominating at Cleveland Heights he committed to Ohio State. He saw action immediately as a true freshman which is impressive given the talent they have had. He never really produced any big numbers though as he finished his career with 8 total sacks.
pros: Loves to hand fight and get the OL off of him when he pass rushes. Solid athlete for the defensive end position. Long arms to keep defenders off. Very good pass rush win rate.
cons: He had no real pass rush plan, just to get the hands off him. No power to his game, no bull rush and mediocre at holding an edge. Slim Frame for a EDGE, needs to really bulk up but already is a senior.
take: Smith has some tools that are good for an edge player but he really lacks the size to be contributing to an NFL team. A team could take him late and put some size on him and coach him up to be a solid player though.
