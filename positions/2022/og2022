cons: Not the best balance, bends at the waist too much. Not a good athlete in space. 5th year senior is when he showed out.
take: Johnson looked like a man amongst boys even against Clemson. He has bad intentions in the run game and is sought in pass pro. He can probably step in day one and start for the a NFL team.

Solid power in his base, lower cut so if he get hands on a defender he will create movement. Versatile, played all the positions minus center. Quick feet in the pass game which helps him mirror.
cons: Short arms, defenders control him to often by getting into his pads. When looking for work he never delivers a kill shot. Gets off balance too much (mostly due to defenders getting to him).
take: Green may have some limitations when it comes to length but that shouldn’t stop him from being a solid guard. His size and movement skills should allow Green to have a successful career and should be a good day 2 pick up.
OG Marcus Mckethan North Carolina 74
info: NA

cons: Foot speed is lacking. Plays high and a little off balance at times

OG Lecitus Smith Virgia Tech 73
info: Smith besides having one of the best names in the draft has the best cookie YouTube videos. Good thing he likes to cook because he needs to keep up his large frame that allowed him to be a 3 year full time starters for the Hookies.
pros: Very flexible and mobile for a 320 pounder. Aggressive run blocker, fires out and runs his feat to burry defenders. A lot of experience playing 350+ snaps for 4 years.
cons: Over aggressive at times that will hurt his technique. Short arms and has a hard time grabbing on to defenders.
take: Smith had a solid career at VT and has the physical and mental tools to be an NFL starter. If it weren’t for his length he would be a higher sought after prospect but regardless he is a solid guard.

He is a smart dude who made honor roll all 6 years he was in college and by the time he got to his senior season he won the SoCon Jacobs Blocking Award Winner which is the top lineman in the conference. He’s already 23 years old but he does have a lot of experience to go with it.
pros: Nasty in the run game, looking to put defenders on the ground. Sturdy base, can absorb blitzers and stalemate them. Good IQ, picks up blitzes well and finds work.
cons: Pass sets could be better, lets outside rushes around too easily. 6th year player at OL. Played a very easy schedule and only good game was Kentucky.
take: Strange was a 23 year old going against 20 year old which makes a difference. He at least looked like it though, bullying kids in the run game and having a strong anchor in the pass game. He should be ready to play day one but may not have much more room for growth.
OG Justin Shaffer Georgia 72
info: Shaffer was buried in the depth chart for a few years but he stuck with his hometown team Georgia. His final two years he finally got the starting job and ran with it. He was named 2nd team All SEC his 5th year and was on the national championship winning team.
pros: Big dude at 6’4 340. Pretty good first step in the run game. Strong lower half, can move DL from their gap. Solid at comboing up to the 2nd level.
cons: Slow to pop up out of his stance in the pass game. Gets bulled too much because he plays too high. Any finesse moves can beat him in pass pro.

OG Dylan Parham Memphis 72

cons: He is a 5th year senior with an off field issue. Slow off the ball and pops up in pass pro. Doesn’t move his feet well to mirror.

cons: Small for the NFL, 6 foot flat and 31 inch arms. Not many pass sets that will translate because the Mercer O. Played against low level comp for his first 3 years at Lenoir Rhyne.
take: Poe is a great pull blocker and that’s his calling card. He can move and is an aggressive blocker that can lead block well. He’s a little small though so he’s got a weird build to be an NFL guard.

pros: Was a first team all big 12 pick back to back years. Looks like an OL, 6’6 320 and was voted a team captain.

cons: Struggles to move laterally especially in pass pro. Not a quick player, feet can be slow to react.

cons: Leg injury halfway through his senior season. 6 year lineman, he’s old. Doesn’t have lateral quickness, and inside rusher that puts a move on him will win.
take: Okafor is a menace in pass protection, if he’s the help guy he will put a DL on his back. One on one is where he struggles, he doesn’t have the lateral agility to handle quick moves.
OG Curtis Blackwell  68
info: NA
pros: Plays with great balance and solid power. Can move and get to the second level and handle rushers.
cons: On the smaller side, not the strongest base to handle power.
