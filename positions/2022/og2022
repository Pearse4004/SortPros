cons: Foot speed is lacking. Plays high and a little off balance at times
take: Munford was a very good offensive lineman for the buckeyes and made up the better half of the left side of the Offensive line. He’s a big strong powerful guard who could most likely step in immediately and play in the NFL.

Solid power in his base, lower cut so if he get hands on a defender he will create movement. Versatile, played all the positions minus center. Quick feet in the pass game which helps him mirror.
cons: Short arms, defenders control him to often by getting into his pads. When looking for work he never delivers a kill shot. Gets off balance too much (mostly due to defenders getting to him).
